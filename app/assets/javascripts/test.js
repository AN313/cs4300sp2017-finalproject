Humble in appearance (knotty-pine paneling with Christmas decorations and tourist art year round), this is the best Dominican food north of the islands.  In the kitchen are 5 grandmas kicking out the best Latin soul food in the city.  Their fried chicken may be the best in town. Their sweet plantains are like little kisses. Gourmet Magazine agrees.  And cheap.  BYOB.  Family style extends to the hours.  They run out of some things after 8 pm.  I've met some of the greats of the merengue and bachata music scenes here.\nCoogan's: 4015 Broadway (between 168th & 169th).  Washington Heights favorite watering hole is the world's only Irish/Dominican bar.

Ten minutes by train but the best brunch in New York for the last 100 years.  The pastrami lox and eggs is sublime.  Best chop liver on the Upper West Side.  \nThe New Leaf Cafe: 1 Margaret Corbin Dr.  Situated off the heather gardens of The Cloisters, which you want to visit, is Bette Midler's cafe in an old stone house.  Maybe the next best brunch after Barney's but one of the most spectacular views in the city.\nEntertainment:\nMinton's: 206 W 118th St (between St. Nick's & 7th Ave).

Richard Parson's loving restoration's upscaled bebop's birthplace into a good reason to dress up and eat extremely well.  Alexander Smalls, Edna Lewis's protege, makes the best low-country Carolina cuisine available in these parts.  This is strictly cool school.

It is quiet and sunny and steps from Riverside Park, on the Hudson River, which boasts some of the best biking and running routes and manicured and forested gardens in NY.  \n\nIt is  4 blocks from Central Park and just a 3-minute walk from an express subway station (2 stops from Times Square), minutes from Columbus Circle, Columbia University, Lincoln Center and Greenwich Village.  And just ascross Central Park on a crosstown bus or leisurely walk you'll arrive at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIt is walking distance to the Natural History Museum, near Symphony Space Theater, and, of course, great markets and restaurants and all the conveniences that NYC has to offer, throughout this incredibly safe neighborhood. \n \nThere is an ELEVATOR, high-speed internet and wi-fi access, iphone chargers & iPod dock with Bose speakers, dvd player, Apple TV and cable TV, including premium movie channels in both the living and bedrooms.  \n\nI provide everything you need (you can leave your umbrellas and iPhone chargers at home) to \"live\" (see list below for details).   \n\nThe bedroom is equipped with a California King Bed.  There is a 2nd HDTV in the bedroom with premium movie channels. The bedroom has soundproof windows - although it is an extremely quiet block - and blackout blinds for those lazy, relaxed, untypical-NYC days. And, of course, beautiful Frette linens and plush towels will be provided, along with toiletries.\n\nThe renovated windowed kitchen has all beautifully upgraded appliances and is fully equipped with Nespresso machine and  a dishwasher.

I'm more than happy to provide transportation assistance, restaurant recommendations (I have a very extensive guest book here and also printed in the apartment) and any other NYC questions you might have.  It's my true pleasure to assist my guests in any way possible to ensure a wonderful stay in the city.\n\nIt's very rare that I need access during a guest's stay, and if at all, it's usually to say hello if I can't be there upon arrival.  ** If you prefer a self check-in let me know and I'll vacate premises prior to your arrival.\n\nThe Parks!  I'm located a block from Riverside Park which is right on the Hudson River with views across to New Jersey.  It has amazing running, walking and biking trails which can take you all the way down to Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty or north to old growth forests and the Cloisters!  I'm also 4 blocks from Central Park - about a 10 minute walk.  And a 10-minute walk to Columbia University.\n\nThe apartment is a 3-minute walk to an Express subway stop - which can take you to Times Square in 10 min - and the financial district/Ground Zero in 20 minutes.   The subway line is the red line - 1/2/3 trains (2 and 3 trains are the EXPRESS trains, 1 is the local).  I recommend the MTA New York website/app for more information, directions, etc., AND/OR the apps itransnyc and HopStop.\n\nTaxi from JFK: taxi fare is a flat rate of $52 + tolls and tip and takes approx 40 minutes to 1 hour (depending on traffic).  \n\nFrom JFK: By subway/train - take AirTrain ($5.00) heading to Jamaica Station and get off at Sutphin Blvd/Jamaica Station.  Transfer to the Manhattan-bound \"E\" subway train ($2.75) heading to World Trade Center and exit at 42nd Street.  Transfer to the 1 (local train) or the 2 OR 3 express train (red line) heading Uptown to 96th St. station (2 stops on express train).  Total trip time will take approx. 1.5 hours max.  More detailed directions provided upon booking.\n\nFrom Newark:  There is no flat rate for taxis and toll into New York is very expensive.  It's approximately an $80-$90 trip - although very convenient.  By train: Take the  Newark Airport AirTrain to Newark Airport Railroad Station.  Transfer to the Northeast Corridor Line heading to New York Penn Station (approx. 30 min).  Transfer to the 2 or 3 express subway train (red line) heading uptown to 96th Street (3 stops).  Total travel time is about an hour.\n\nFrom LaGuardia:  Take a taxi.  It's the closest airport to the city and there's no AirTrain or subway - only busses.  It'll be approx. $40 total (incl. tax & toll) and takes approx. 20 minutes without traffic to 35 min. with traffic.\n\nOther car service options:  UBER and VIA (download the apps) or to book a car in advance: Dial 7 or Carmel.\n\nFrom Penn Station:  1/2/3 trains (the red line) Uptown to 96th St station (2 and 3 trains are express trains and just 3 stops from Penn). \n\nMore detailed directions provided upon booking.\n\nIt's my main residence so it's not devoid of things you'll need to \"live\" and hopefully make your stay the best ever!!!

I make sure each guest feels properly at home! The neighborhood has great food, friendly people, and offers easy access in and out of Manhattan.\n\nRight in the heart of Fort Greene, this is my garden apartment in a traditional Brooklyn Brownstone!  You are just steps away from all of the restaurants, cafes, and things to do in Fort Greene Brooklyn.  It is a very friendly, safe, and charming neighborhood. The apartment's location makes it easy to get in and out of Manhattan through public transit or car, and also is very convenient to Williamsburg, Park Slope, and Carroll Gardens.\n\nI want you to feel comfortable in my home.  Among a fully stocked kitchen with enough room for two to cook AND eat in (what a concept for new york!). (And thanks to the suggestions of a few airbnb guests, I now have a coffee maker!)  Unfortunately, the washer/dryer is not functional.\n\nThe bed has a super comfortable pillow top mattress and high quality sheets. There is a walk-in closet in the bedroom with hanger space for your clothes.  There is a couch which has the option of pulling out into a flat bed. This pullout can comfortably sleep one person.  In the bedroom, there is a large work area with access to a printer. \n\nI have fast wifi and my HD projector is attached to an AppleTV and DVD Player. I do not have cable TV.\n\nThere is a great backyard to sit out and have evening drinks. The backyard is shared with my landlord, who lives above me and maintains it. Because of this, we have access to only the area underneath the porch, not the area with the benches...\n\nThere are multiple CitiBike stations within 3 blocks of the apartment. You can rent bikes by the hour/day/week. Check it out online! It's a great way to see Brooklyn and Manhattan!\n\nNearby fun neighborhood stuff includes:\nFort Greene Park - 1 block away\nFarmers Market - 2 blocks away (Sat only)\nBAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) - 3 blocks away\nBarclays Center - 4 blocks away\nBrooklyn Flea (a local favorite!) - 3 blocks away\nHabana Outpost (best mojitos in Brooklyn!) - 1 block away\nCrunch Gym - 4 blocks away\nBrooklyn Botanical Gardens - 2 subway stops away\nBRIC House for the Arts (Opened last year!) - 5 blocks away\n\nI am right off the C and G subways, and 4 blocks from the B/D, Q/N/R, 2/3, 4/5 subways and the Long Island Rail Road. You can be in lower Manhattan in 15 minutes. Getting to JFK is easy through the LIRR. \n\nYou are literally in the middle of everything. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.\n\nIf you stay for 4 days or longer, I'll include a free 5 day pass to the gym for you and one guest! Be sure to mention that to me ahead of time so I can  have a pass ready for you.\n\nBecause this apartment is a brownstone in the heart of Brooklyn, there are factors you should consider before renting:\n\n- My bedroom does face an active city street and bus stop which can get noisy with city buses and cars. If you consider yourself a light sleeper, you may want to think twice.  Anybody accustomed to mild city living would most likely not be bothered.\n\n- Cell phone reception in the apartment is extremely poor. AT&T is almost non-existent. Verizon is spotty at best. T-Mobile works well. You can get reception by the windows with most providers.\n\n- Because the apartment is not outfitted to be child safe, we ask that no children under 6 years old accompany you during your stay. \n\n- I love pets more than anybody, but unfortunately, my landlord asks not to have them in the apartment.\n\nThere is a great backyard to sit out and have evening drinks. The backyard is shared with my landlord, who lives above me and maintains it. Because of this, we have access to only the area underneath the porch, not the area with the benches...\n\nI usually get a chance to meet my guests, but not always. You will most likely be on your own during your stay, however, if you want to grab a drink or a bite to eat, I would love that.\n\nWe have such a diverse neighborhood in Fort Greene, and everybody is really friendly. If you stumble in a bar or restaurant, be sure to strike up a conversation, b/c I find the life stories of people around here to be very unique. The neighborhood has also become a hot spot for culture with a Shakespearean center and the Bric performing arts center within a 5 minute walk of the apartment.\n\nThe Barclays Center would never have been built if this area weren't a major hub for travel. You have most of the major subway lines (2,3,4,5,B,D,Q,N,R,C,G) and also the Long Island Rail (URL HIDDEN) a 5 minute drive from both the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Cabs are easy to come by. \n\nFree parking can be found on every street around my apartment. Although not always readily available, my guests have never complained, and have said it was easier than they thought it would be. It's BEST to find a spot at night time (after 6pm), and not in the morning before noon.\n\nFrom the 3 airports, cab is always an option. From Newark, you can take public transit by means of bus or from shuttle/train/subway. From Laguardia, you should uber. From JFK, you can take shuttle/subway or shuttle/Long Island Rail Road (fastest)", "name": "Lovely Garden Apt. in Fort Greene."}, {"url": "airbnb.com/rooms/2096641.json", "id": "2096641.json", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/28712525/f1800896_original.jpg?aki_policy=large", "description": "This loft apartment in the SoHo/Nolita epicenter is the perfect location for shopping, dining, and accessing the rest of NYC. I'm a native New Yorker and will be available to give recommendations for where to go, no matter your budget or interests!\n\nThis is a fully-furnished but minimalist-looking loft space in a converted textile factory. I've retained the industrial character of the original space while providing the comforts you're used to at home--leather couch, comfortable bed, flatscreen with satellite, Wi-Fi. And unlike other buildings, the apartment has its own hot-water boiler, so you're not going to run out of hot water in the shower, no matter when you want to use it.\n\nThe space can sleep 4 people; there is one full-size bed, and I also have a full-size, full-height air mattress I will set up if your party is more than 2. Setting up the air mattress makes the bedroom a bit tight, but it can be moved into the other room if you prefer.\n\nYou have full access to everything in the apartment.\n\nUse our enormous Map Wall to plan your day's itinerary. The apartment is dead-center between SoHo, Nolita and Chinatown, so you can find cool stuff in every direction. I've covered the map in dry-erase coating, so I can mark whatever you need to find--ATMs, subway stations, good chow spots, Citibike stations, public bathrooms with no line, et cetera. Or you can mark it up yourself to plan routes and destinations of your own. Even if you have a bad sense of direction, I can provide clear directions to ensure you never get lost--and I'm always just a phone call or a knock away.\n\nLeather couch and easy chair, for when you want to plop down in front of the flatscreen and watch satellite TV.\n\nFull-size bed in the bedroom, and for a second bed we've got a full-size, full-height airbed I can set up for you.\n\nThe kitchen has your standard microwave, burners, coffeemaker, electric kettle for you tea-drinkers, and of course a full-sized refrigerator; but I doubt you'll be cooking once you see the amazing range of takeout, delivery and dine-in options the neighborhood has to offer!\n\nThe dining table is expandable and will seat 4-8 people.\n\nYou control the temperature, in case you're one of those folks that gets hot or cold easily; the thermostat is right on the wall, so you're not at the mercy of someone else's temperature choices. Crank up the heat, or the A/C, to wherever you like it.\n\nThe apartment is all yours and fully private; I stay out of your way to give you privacy, but I'm immediately available (in another unit in the building) if you need anything. When you want recommendations, advice or suggestions on anything at all, just drop me a line and I'm there for you. Otherwise, I don't stick my head in unless I'm asked for.\n\nLocated at the epicenter of SoHo, Nolita and Chinatown, this location is a shopping, dining and NYC-access paradise. Whether you're on a tight budget or looking to throw some cash around, you can find whatever you need within mere blocks--and sometimes on the same block! If you don't trust your guidebook, copy of Time Out or Yelp reviews, ask me and I'll help you find what you're looking for--while steering you clear of the tourist traps. Again, native New Yorker here!\n\nThe subway is just two blocks away, both north and south of here. If you prefer taxis, the side entrance of the building puts you directly on Centre Street--a major taxi thoroughfare. Prefer to bike? There's a Citibike station just one block away. Rather walk? You can hit Broadway, SoHo, NoLita, Little Italy, Chinatown in less than 3 blocks, depending on which direction you head in. If you're willing to go further, Tribeca, the Village and the East Village are 7-10 blocks away. And if you've got a ZipCar membership, there's a ZipCar lot just one block away. \n\nWhenever I travel, I like to know where I'm going to eat and drink! If you're looking for cheap eats, in the same building as the apartment is a Thai restaurant and the last NYC-style diner-coffee shop in the area. If you want cappuccino or fancier coffee in the mornings, there's a high-end coffee shop right next door, plus there are nearby Starbucks in three directions. For those with more refined taste, right across the street is a French restaurant and a Chilean wine shop.\n\nThere's a killer Scotch bar just one block east; a fantastic brunch spot one block north; the world's cheapest Chinese food buffet, one block south. Or start your morning with a cafe au lait and croissant at Balthazar, just two blocks north.\n\nNeed authentic-style NYC pizza? Little Italy starts one block away. (Ask me where to go so you don't get suckered by the fake, overpriced stuff.)\n\nAs for shopping, Broadway and SoHo's reputations speak for themselves--you can find everything under the sun just blocks from the apartment, so you can keep dropping stuff off and using the bathroom if you're on a spree. The clothing and shoe stores alone would take up more space than I can fit here. \n\nIf you need unique souvenirs that can't be found back home, ask me and I'll help you find shops that have the perfect gifts.\n\nOne last thing I need to be clear about--the last photo you see up above, the Beaux Arts building exterior, is the Police Department from 1909 (now converted to luxury condos). That is *not* this building, that is the building across the street! That building is the view that you see outside the windows of this apartment--and it's gorgeous.", "name": "SoHo/Nolita loft apartment"}, {"url": "airbnb.com/rooms/1245714.json", "id": "1245714.json", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/60502143/e479238d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large", "description": "A quiet, romantic, light and art-filled oasis overlooking the park in Harlem's #1 historic district!

Central Park near-by.\n\nThis is a uniquely situated full floor apartment that doubles as an art gallery. You will enjoy the wonderful views onto Marcus Garvey Park and north onto the wide boulevard of Mount Morris Park West and its gracious restored town houses that border the park on the west. And when you tire of the park views, you will enjoy the changing art exhibits that decorate the walls. Please check Tikhonova Wintner Fine Art online to see what's current in the gallery (just in case we don't have the same taste!).\n\nThis a very comfortable and relaxing space that is perfectly suited for a peaceful respite, a romantic dinner, or as home base from which to explore the intricacies of Harlem and greater New York City. We are very close to the Studio Museum in Harlem, and walking distance to Museum Mile on 5th Ave (Metropolitan, Guggenheim, Frick, and Jewish Museums, the Museum of the City of New, and Museo del Barrio). For serious art lovers we are also walking distance to the Metro North train that will take you to the celebrated DIA Foundation in Beacon, NY, on a lovely train ride that follows along the edge of the Hudson River's un-rivalled beauty.\n\nAlthough this is a particularly congenial space for a couple, if you are traveling with small children (or a friend) they can be comfortably accommodated. \n\nSome history:\nWe moved to this apartment May 1, 2013 after Hurricane Sandy precipitated an unplanned move from previous digs in the South Street Seaport.

You'll love it too!\n\nThere is a washer dryer in the basement. And super fast (50Mb) wifi in the apartment. Heat is controlled by each apartment. For summer, fans supplement the floor through cross ventilation. No TV, but the wifi is robust enough for any streaming. \n\nWe will probably be traveling out of the city during your visit, but available at all times by cellphone. We would like to arrange schedules so we can meet you when you arrive and will give priority to that possibility. Otherwise, our close friend and neighbor will meet you, share local knowledge,  and be available as needed.\n\nOur block is almost all restored brownstones, and we are surrounded by beautifully restored buildings that are an important element of the surrounding views and the street adjacent to the park. If you enjoy period architecture, there is no better place to start exploring.\n\nOur Harlem neighborhood is replete with history, legend, lore, reputation, mystery, and myths galore. \n\nIt's all here and then some, as the neighborhood rapidly evolves, with new restaurants and retail opening seemingly every day; and architectural restorations and new buildings keeping pace (or is it vice-versa?). It's safe and quiet, especially in our beautiful Mount Morris Park Historic District. Nearby dining highlights include Settepani, Barawine, Chez Lucienne, Red Rooster; and music at Paris Blues, Shrine, and the landmark VFW Post on 132nd St. The Studio Museum in Harlem is nearby; and the bus downstairs will take you directly to Museum Mile on 5th Ave (El Museo del Barrio, Museum of the City of New York, Jewish Museum, Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art are ten minutes away by bus, or a leisurely walk in the Park).\n\nThere's no end of resources online, so you can easily find what you desire. One invaluable local and very up to date resource is the Harlem Bespoke blog. I read it every day to find the newest news. If you are planning to visit Harlem, start reading now. You will be a native speaker long before your arrival.\n\nExpress subways (Underground/Metro) and many buses are easily accessible. On street parking is good (more on that in person).
