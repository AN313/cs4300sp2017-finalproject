{"description": "My place is close to Central Park, Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center. You\u2019ll love my place because of its central location, close to subways and busses, great restaurants, bars, cafes, entertainment and shopping, but on a quiet treelined street.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\nThe bed is a Murphy Bed with a comfortable (real) full size mattress.", "name": "Quiet Studio near Central Park.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/76feaec3-4747-4bc8-b60f-1f0e2fc5a74a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16212767", "id": "16212767", "price": 125}
