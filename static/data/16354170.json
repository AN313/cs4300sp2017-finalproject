{"description": "My apartment is a two bedroom with a separate living room and kitchen area. It also has a large backyard which is nice for barbecuing and relaxing in the hot months. There is a queen size bed, full size bed and four large queen size futons.  My place is close to BZ Grill, Elias Corner, and Basil Brick Oven Pizza. You\u2019ll love my place because of the outdoors space and the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\nThe space is quiet large and has an open lay out. There is a TV in the living room and the kitchen is fully equipped with everything needed for cooking and preparing food. There is a microwave and toaster as well.  It is located in a two family home which my family owns and the apartment is on the first floor.\n\nGuests have access to the entire apartment and the backyard.\n\nMyself or my sister are always available when needed. We are just a text away.\n\nAstoria/Long Island City is a very cool and hip neighborhood. Not to mention one of the safest in New York City. It is known for its restaurants, hip bars and cool Beer Gardens, yes that is right, there are two beer gardens in Astoria. One is called Bohemka and is walking distance from the house. Other great places to visit locally is Astoria Park and its views of NYC skyline.\n\nThere is the N/W train three blocks from the house. On the Astoria Blvd Stop.
