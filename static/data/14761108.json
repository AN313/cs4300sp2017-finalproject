Her lovely apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Nolita, my favorite area in Manhattan. To make my stay even more enjoyable, I mistakingly left a valuable item in her apartment and she was so helpful and willing to return it to me speedily. You'd be crazy not to stay here. Thanks again for a wonderful stay, Margaux!"}
