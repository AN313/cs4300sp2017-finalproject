{"description": "Located on the upper end of the Upper East Side, my apartment is close to tons of restaurants, parks (Central Park is a 15 min walk west), shopping on 86th street, and the 4/5 express trains. My apartment is in a quiet building and I have a full sized mattress that you'll fall in love with. For groups that need more than one queen bed, my couch also pulls out into a queen Bob-O-Pedic mattress. It's a great place to come relax in after a long day in the city!\n\nYou will have the entire apartment with a private bath! Located about a 10 minute walk to the subway, Central Park and the East River! About a 30 minute commute to Times Square!\n\nWhole studio (with closet space and drawers for clothes) and the private bathroom. Laundry access is available upon request.\n\nI am staying across the street with my boyfriend during your visit so I'm close by if you need me and out of your hair if you don't!\n\nThe neighborhood is fantastic because there are a lot of unique local restaurants and bars but at the same time it is quant.\n\nSubways is about a 10 minute walk away! Lots of bus stops and taxis around as well!", "name": "Upper East Side Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6268799f-4e60-47fa-9f56-01728c7b0ea5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15579256", "id": "15579256", "price": 145, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival.
