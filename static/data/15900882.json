{"description": "There is one bed in the bedroom, and in the living room the couch converts to a bed. The apartment is equipped with basic appliances, such as: 47\" Flat Screen TV, wireless Internet service, linens, towels, and soap. The apartment is located just three short blocks from the N and Q Trains with less than 10 minutes to Times Square, Brooklyn, & more fun places. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient for everyday needs.\n\nThis is a large but cozy one bedroom apartment with everything you need to get by the night and day with friends and family. There's enough room to dance or call it a movie night.\n\nI am accessible to my guests 24 hours, don't hesitate to shoot me a text or email.\n\nThe neighborhood is a block away from a diverse choice of restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies, & bars.\n\nPretty much everything is walking distance but if you need public transportation the N & Q are three short blocks away, there are three different bus routes in a few block radius & taxis are picked up under the train station on 31 street between Ditmars Blvd and 23rd avenue.", "name": "Large one bedroom with a homey feel", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d4c011b1-6244-47ab-9532-83339b64e171.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15900882", "id": "15900882", "price": 120, "review": " "}
