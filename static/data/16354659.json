Great place for food, drinks and travel convenience as well. Host was very accommodating, nice, clear & efficient in conveying his messages. Appreciated that he also checked on how things were going midway through my stay and for leaving behind a welcome message and homekeeping items. Enjoyed the stay and would recommend this for travellers who'd like a great location and somewhere quieter in East Village."}
