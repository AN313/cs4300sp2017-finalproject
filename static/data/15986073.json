Although we didn't get to see him in person, he made sure we were comfortable and had everything prepared upon our arrival. The place was clean and was close to the supermarket which helped us settle in the first night of our stay. The kitchen was well-equipped and we were able to have a nice home cooked meal for dinner and even a great breakfast. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Definitely recommend this place for people looking for a good yet inexpensive place to stay in while visiting New York. "}
