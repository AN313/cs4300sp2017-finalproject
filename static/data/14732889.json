The unit is in a great location in Brooklyn, very spacious, well set up and very comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay tremendously and much because of our find on Airbnb.  This spot is close to subway lines, great restaurants and the park.  Definitely would positively recommend this place.  We'd use it again."}
