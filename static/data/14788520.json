We particularly appreciated the thoughtful touches such as toiletries, the NYC guide book, map of Manhattan, candles and great coffee.\n\nThe apartment was lovely and clean, location was great with many restaurants and bars within a couple of blocks (and Rebecca left some brilliant recommendations of places to try, which were well worth following), and the neighborhood felt safe.\n\nWe would recommend people to stay with Rebecca, and will certainly be looking to do so ourselves next time we head stateside."}
