{"description": "You will love this beautiful artist loft with huge windows, high ceilings, tons of light, and a fully furnished bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. It has Sonos speakers to help you relax, and beautiful lighting you can control from your iPhone. Close to Williamsburg, Clinton Hill, Pratt University, Prospect Park, Barclays Center, and just a 30-40 minute train ride from most Manhattan locations. It is perfect for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (dogs only please).", "name": "900 sq. ft.
