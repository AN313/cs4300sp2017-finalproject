{"description": "This is a perfect place for your trip to New York. The loft is very cozy, and is equipped with a queen sized bed, cable tv, wifi and a marble fireplace. You can't find a better location to have full access to NYC.\n\nThe loft is located in a family owned building that has been in our family for 40 years. Its very cozy and has a full kitchen, great afternoon sun and an extremely comfortable mattress.\n\nThe entire place is yours. Enjoy!\n\nI live in the building and will only be around if needed.\n\nIn the heart of Chelsea, 3 blocks to the high line, short walk to the Whitney museum, meat packing district, Chelsea galleries. Whole foods around the corner. Plenty of restaurants and bars. Perfect place to enjoy NYC\n\nEasy access to all public transport and a parking garage on the corner", "name": "Cozy loft in Chelsea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e01ae95d-5093-48e1-a1f0-e6979478cfdd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16107664", "id": "16107664", "price": 150, "review": "Great location in Chelsea and easy to get around the city by foot or subway. Beware the low ceilings and lots of ads-ons to the room price, but overall worth it for the location and extra space. We had a wonderful stay. "}
