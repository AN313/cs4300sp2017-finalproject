Ein idealer Ausgangspunkt, um sich Manhattan zu erschlie\u00dfen. Gute Ausstattung. Durch die N\u00e4he zur Manhattan-Bridge ist die Underground \u00fcber den East-River gut zu h\u00f6ren. Ohrst\u00f6psel sind hilfreich. Die Treppe zum 4. OG erfordert - insbesondere mit Gep\u00e4ck - etwas Kondition. "}
