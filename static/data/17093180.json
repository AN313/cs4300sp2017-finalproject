The apartment was in a convenient location close to a subway stop, and the futon was comfortable. He left some breakfast items and water out, which was much appreciated. Small issues is that the walls are thin, and sometimes the neighbors can be a little rowdy on Fri/Sat nights, but the noise didn't last very long. "}
