{"description": "Welcome to Marion Street in Bedstuy! We are long time Brooklyn residents, but recently moved to this block where we have been slowly restoring this beautiful dream home. Lauren and I are both friendly and social. We are excited to host you and share our NYC experience - a city we both love. We use AirBnB on our travels and understand what it takes to be a great host.\n\nOver the past few months we have been restoring this beautiful home.  \n\nYour private space is the garden level of a brick- brownstone with plenty of day light throughout.  We live upstairs should you have any questions.\nYour bedroom is over looking the backyard garden. There's an outdoor space with reclaimed brick patio. \nOriginal details throughout: tin ceilings, plaster moldings, wood panel doors, original floors.\n\nRenovated kitchen and bath with a towel warmer.\nWasher and dryer.\nLarge closets.\n\nThe daybed in the living room can accommodate one person.  We also have a Japanese buckwheat floor mattress should you need it.\n\nFresh linens and towels provided. 100% cotton. \n\nJ train at Chauncey St, A/C train at Rockaway Ave, L train at Bushwick Ave/Aberdeen.  We are very accessible to all parts of NYC.\n\nOnce your reservation is confirmed, please check back as other information becomes available (e.g. WiFi password, detailed directions, and check-out procedure).\n\nPlease feel at home.  You have access to the backyard garden.  Your space also has a private kitchen and living room to read or watch TV.  There's also a washer and dryer on site.\n\nWe are accommodating to our guests. We will respect your space; however, we are more than happy to provide any information should you need it.\n\nMarion Street is a Brooklyn gem!\n\nWe live on a quiet tree lined block with a new and well maintained city park across the street.\nJazz festival and other community activities organized by a strong block association.\nMentioned as one of the \"Greenest Blocks in Brooklyn\" by the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.\n\nTo be near a subway line is nice, but to be within a few short blocks of 3 subway lines is better!  Airports, Brooklyn and Manhattan sites could not be more accessible.\n\nWe are a 1 minute walk to the J train, a 5 min walk to the A/C train, and a 10 min walk to the L train. \n\nBoth the J and A/C trains go directly to and from JFK airport.", "name": "Brooklyn Historic Brownstone with Garden", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b9954c38-e49f-45d5-ba21-c62cfbfe644a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15648993", "id": "15648993", "price": 79, "review": "Merci \u00e0 Lauren et Anthony qui nous ont accueillis chaleureusement malgr\u00e9 un retard cons\u00e9quent ....\nL'appartement est tr\u00e8s confortable spacieux lumineux et bien d\u00e9cor\u00e9 on se sent tout de suite chez soi....\nLe petit jardin derri\u00e8re est adorable \nLa rue \u00e0 la sortie de l'arr\u00eat de m\u00e9tro est moche et sale mais d\u00e8s qu'on la traverse cette mauvaise impression disparait \nd\u00e8s qu'on d\u00e9couvre ces jolies brownstones bordant des rues tranquilles \nAllez y c'est un New york authentique !!"}
