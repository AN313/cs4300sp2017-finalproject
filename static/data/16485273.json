{"description": "My place is close to Darling Coffee, Garden Caf\u00e9, Grandpa's Brick Oven Pizza, and Yummy Thai, The Cloisters, Inwood Hill Park, Fort Tyron Park.\nYou\u2019ll love my place because of  the location, the parks, the ambiance, proximity to Express train. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nI'm on the fourth floor of a quiet elevator building on the best street in Inwood! The apartment is at the back of the building, so there is really no street noise. This apartment is both generously proportioned and cozy.\n\nThe whole apartment is yours to use. There is laundry in the basement as well. The kitchen is large and clean- feel free to use it! I'll leave some nice coffee and tea for you to help yourselves to. You can use the wifi, the Amazon firestick ( a device which allows you to stream pretty much any movie or tv show), the wii-u and games. There are also plenty of fun board games to use.\n\nBoth the A and 1 trains are very close. The A is 2 blocks away and gets you to midtown in 30 minutes.", "name": "Quiet, clean, comfortable place in upper Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7e683ffa-096b-4545-9f16-ec519417b8fe.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16485273", "id": "16485273", "price": 100}
