{"description": "My place is at the heart of the East Village - lively streets and amazing availability of restaurants, shops and nightlife. It is however cozy and very quiet, being on the 6th floor (note though: no elevator) and facing away from the street. 3 minutes walk from the L-train stop to the west side and to Brooklyn, and up to 10 minutes walk to stops on the 4, 5, 6, N, R, and F trains. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Cute 1-bedroom in the East Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5de1d03c-78a8-4332-9162-801b75e40877.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15633727", "id": "15633727", "price": 140, "review": "Everything went smooth.  Place is in a great location.  The only con was the 6 floor walk up."}
