{"description": "My place is close to Archie's Bar & Pizza, Silent Barn, Bossa Nova Civic Club, Miles and Birdie's.  It's only a five-minute walk from the Central M train stop and a ten-minute walk from the Jefferson L stop.\n\nYou\u2019ll love my place because of my tidy, easy-going and friendly roommate and my sweet cat, the home-y and comfortable feel of the quiet apartment, and the neighborhood, which is full of great places to eat, drink and view art.\n\nPlease note cleaning fee and extra person charge. Thanks.\n\nYou will most likely be dealing with my lovely roommate, who is happy to give you tips on places to enjoy.", "name": "Cozy bedroom in a home-y Bushwick place", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ad9e5c97-d433-4d3a-8bd7-b83aa08a6567.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16415673", "id": "16415673", "price": 70}
