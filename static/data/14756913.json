{"description": "My place is close to Peaches, Chez Oskar and the A/C subway stop. You\u2019ll love my place because of the light, the kitchen, and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nBeautiful loft apt., full of light, on a quiet block of Bed-Stuy.\nMinutes to the subway train and new restaurants around the corner.\n\nThere is one real bed for two and a futon that can sleep another two people.\n\nYou will have the whole loft for yourself.\n\nA few blocks from the A/C train at Utica - 30mn to central Manhattan.", "name": "Beautiful loft apt. on quiet Bed-Stuy block", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e804dcd4-e768-4fd0-ac91-31ee01d6c77f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14756913", "id": "14756913", "price": 120, "review": "Valentina's place was perfect. It was quiet, clean, and Valentina was in touch whenever I needed her for anything. The place is in a beautiful neighbourhood, residential enough that I could sleep easily, but still with fantastic cafes and restaurants just around the corner. And The A and C trains stop just two blocks away, so you can get to anywhere on Manhattan really easily (and it's only 20 mins to lower Manhattan). It's relatively large for a NY studio apartment, and would definitely comfortably fit at least two people for a while. This is the first of many AirBnB's I've had in NY that I wish I could stay longer in, and I would be happy living here. Thank you Valentina for being a fantastic host, and your beautiful place!"}
