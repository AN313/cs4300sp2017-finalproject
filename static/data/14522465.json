{"description": "A bright apartment in a hip neighborhood! Central Air, laundry, jacuzzi size tub, balcony, and roof access! Near trendy cafes, galleries, and bars! \n\nA 30 minute train ride to Manhattan!\n\nThis apartment is regular-looking on the outside, and pretty damned nice within. The tub is like a swimming pool, the ceilings are high, the light plentiful. When it's warm, the balcony and roof are great to hang out on, and central air can cool one off. When it's cold, the heat is plentiful, a warm bath is luxurious, and there are books all around for jumping into. There's also a washer and dryer and dishwasher in the apartment, so doing laundry and dishes is a breeze. It's an excellent refuge in the busy world of New York in general, and Bushwick in particular.\n\nBedroom, Kitchen, Living Room, Bathroom, Roof, Balcony, Laundry.\n\nAny help you need, I'll be around.\n\nBushwick is very lively. I live in a more residential part--a short walk takes you to reams of bars and restaurants (best Mexican food in the city!) There are galleries and coffee shops and film houses, too. Lots to do, and good people, too.\n\nYes! Gates, J train, 1 block away.\n\nMy cat is possibly the most lovable creature ever born and she can fly the coop or stick around.", "name": "Grand Apartment in Hip Bushwick!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1ffc218c-3128-4706-ab06-d8b0c02edcb4.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14522465", "id": "14522465", "price": 100, "review": "To start he is very welcoming and his home is cozy and chill.
