{"description": "A modern corner apartment opposite Luke's Lobster (1 of 3 locations in NYC - highly recommended), and The Comic Strip (featuring comedians like Louise CK). Also down the road from the Metropolitan Museum of Art - next to Central Park East. \n\nYou\u2019ll love the voice activated lights, home entertainment system (Bose surround sound & Projector), endless dinning options your first step out the front door, and comic strip vibes. \n\nA cozy space for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nUse the 4,5,6 to get Downtown. Taxis are readily available on 1st and 2nd ave.  Uber is a great and affordable way to get around town as well", "name": "Modern 1 Bedroom Apartment Near Central Park East", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/efca0db7-e2cb-46a9-a6e3-47aa21b39283.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16047916", "id": "16047916", "price": 94, "review": "Tolu is a very communicative and nice guy. He helped us very quickly with all our questions and it was very easy to contact him all the time.\nThe location of the apartment is perfect. The subway station is only 5 minutes away and with the Q line you get to the Times Square in only 10 minutes. In the neighborhood you find many places where you can eat and drink. The apartment itself is simple, the bed was really comfortable, the bathroom is old and tiny but it was clean.\nJust the kitchen was not as we expected, the fridge was not very clean, there were no plates or any other equipment and the light was broken.\n\nAll in all we enjoyed our stay because of the perfect location and the communicative host.\n"}
