Man gut die Subway Linie Q (72 Street) erreichen. Man muss einige Treppen steigen 4. Stock), ein Aufzug ist nicht vorhanden. Es sind zwei kleine L\u00e4den, bei denen man sich gut mit Lebensmitteln und auch Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck to go versorgen kann unten im Geb\u00e4ude.\nIch w\u00fcrde die Wohnung wieder buchen. Das einzige, was uns etwas gest\u00f6rt hat, waren die zwei Heizungsrohre (?) die zeitweise warum auch immer ziemlich hei\u00df waren. Dadurch wurde es teilweise sehr warm in der Wohnung. \nAnsonsten war alles top!"}
