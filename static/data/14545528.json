The space is very clean and spacious with modern finishes mixed in with some vintage. We stayed for a weekend and had no trouble finding street parking in the neighborhood. There are lots of different types of cuisine readily available within walking distance of the place and Sarah also gave us great recommendations on where to go as well. The train station is also only a couple blocks away so getting into the city was super easy. There were no unpleasant surprises during our stay because Sarah was very thorough and answered all of our questions. Highly recommend trying this place out!"}
