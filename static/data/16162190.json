{"description": "My place is close to so many great restaurants and cafes. Too many to mention. Williamsburg is easily the coolest and most sought out after neighborhood in New York city. You\u2019ll love my place because of it's authenticity. It has a very old school, vintage, home-y feel that you can't duplicate. The building is old but it's renovated so everything is fully functional. All the appliances are super heavy duty and made of steel. The walls are real concrete. They don't make them like this anymore.", "name": "Huge 2BR Apartment in Williamsburg, BK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/979fc0a2-7949-4ec0-a3ac-bac8d502e944.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16162190", "id": "16162190", "price": 120, "review": "Wayne is a super host, punctuate and clear in his communication.\nThe location is great for a visit to New York with a Subway (L line) two blocks away and supermarket one block away.\nThe apartment is very \"rustic\" with old kitchen and bathroom. Some noise from the street."}
