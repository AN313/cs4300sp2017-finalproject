{"description": "My place is close to restaurants and dining, nightlife, shopping centers, 24 hrs Rite Aid pharmacy, public transport, JFK/Laguardia airport, 30 minutes from Manhattan (car). You\u2019ll love my place because of the balcony with a great 7th floor view! The feel of my place makes you feel cozy and welcomed!  And I will do whatever I can to be sure that you love your stay! My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Luxury Condo 1 BDR, w/ A Great 7th Story View", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d289b62b-671e-4225-a3a4-c73ce9a2cffd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14275887", "id": "14275887", "price": 115, "review": "Kimberly was an amazing host. She is friendly and got back with me immediately when I messaged her. The condo is just as the photos. All the amenities, great TV, cable, roku and apple tv. Very clean, quiet building and safe neighborhood. If coming from JFK airport after you walk miles to baggage claim just take the Airtran to Jamaica Station. Depending on your time of arrival and how much luggage you have you can either take a cab which are lined up waiting, ride public bus transportation or even walk to the condo. The condo is located close to Jamaica Ave. for all your discount shopping and dining needs. The location is very convenient and the subway is nearby along with buses. I would highly recommend this place to  singles or couples. "}
