{"description": "My one bedroom apartment in Red Hook is perfect for someone looking for a home away from home for the holidays. The kitchen comes stocked with everything you'd need to cook meals and Fairway Market is just a few blocks away. There are excellent coffee shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. Manhattan is a short bus and train ride away. You'll be living in a quiet neighborhood with a waterfront view of the Statue of Liberty a few blocks away.", "name": "Charming One Bedroom in Red Hook BK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3db56c44-6a1e-4f83-b6ff-f9e7cb03212e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16318367", "id": "16318367", "price": 100}
