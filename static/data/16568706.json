{"description": "We are a young professional couple who love traveling. \nThe apartment has an in-unit washer/dryer, bathtub, 50\" TV, a Queen bed with memory foam and a couch for a third guest. The complex has a chic rooftop, barbecue area, bike storage, and a 24/7 doorman.\n\nWe're on a quiet block but close to everything. There's a Highline entrance on our block. We're close to Hudson Yards, many parks and galleries, Penn Station, and the 1, 7, and A/C/E lines.\n\nGuests will have access to the rooftop, and ground floor indoor/outdoor common space.\n\nSleep No More - The famous interactive theater experience at the McKittrick Hotel is just a block away. I also highly recommend you checking out their rooftop bar, the Gallow Green, before or after your show!\nTake a walk on the Highline, which will take you straight to the Chelsea Market. Make sure to go with a hungry stomach!\nWe're also very close to Hudson Yards, Penn Station, the frying pan and Chelsea Piers!", "name": "Chic luxury apartment by Highline", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6caf1844-e997-4e38-b37a-7622c6dec25a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16568706", "id": "16568706", "price": 140, "review": "Great apartment and fantastic location.
