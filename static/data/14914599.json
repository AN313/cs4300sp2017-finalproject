It was cozy and comfortable, and the kitchen was stocked with all the equipment we needed to whip up some good meals. It is in the heart of Brooklyn so it's not necessarily tranquil all the time, but overall it's exactly what you'd expect from a garden basement apartment. A good value and I'd consider going back again. \n\nMichael was also very good about communication, and I thank him for his courtesy during the rental process."}
