{"description": "Relax in this sunny 1 bedroom apartment located in the heart of Nolita's incredible restaurants and shops. Everyone says that this is the best neighborhood in NYC. \n\nJust a 3-minute walk to the subway.\n\nModern yet cozy and comfortable furniture. Skylight in the living room, and a collection of books.\n\nI have tons of recommendations for the neighborhood, and as a New York for the past 8 years, happy to suggest fun things to do in the city.\n\nGreat neighborhood of boutiques, cafes and restaurants. The \"hippest\" neighborhood in New York.\n\n2 blocks from the the 6 train, and 3 from the N and R.\n\nThe apartment is up 4 flights of stairs without an elevator.", "name": "Light-filled 1 bedroom in Nolita/Soho", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b5507e2d-84c2-4032-8271-e9ed18ae6430.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15109985", "id": "15109985", "price": 258, "review": "Liz was extremely professional and made the process easy.
