It's truly my favorite part of the city, just blocks away from all the most vibrant, interesting area of New York City. It's alive and exciting and still feels like thriving diverse area for of great photo opportunities and tasty food - exactly what I moved to NYC for! There are hundreds of shops featuring oddities, jewelry and every possible ethnic and fusion cuisine. The Tenement Museum and New Museum are in easy walking distance as well as dozens of galleries. There are also many parks in the area ranging from large city block sized ones to tiny hidden community gardens. One of my favorite things to do is grab a coffee in the early morning and watch hundreds of elderly chinese people do synchronized Tai Chi in Chelsea Park.\n\nHeading East there are all the bars, restaurants, nightlife and music that make the Lower East Side so hip and desirable. While going west you'll hit Chinatown, Little Italy and SoHo in quick succession.\n\nFor more detail check out the Lower East Side Business Improvement website for all the information you might want on restaurants, galleries and more online.\n\nIt's a couple short blocks to the Subway and a 5-10 minute walk to SoHo, East Village and historic Little Italy.
