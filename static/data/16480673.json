{"description": "Cute and bright west village apartment. Can host 4 people. Great location, near the 1, A,C, F & M lines. A lot of restaurants, coffee shops, small boutiques. 5 min walk away from the Hudson River with a beautiful view of the One World Trade Center.\n\nWe just moved in so we haven't decorated it yet, that is why it looks a little empty on the pictures :)", "name": "Cute West Village Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c998c1a0-fd29-445b-905b-6ce79608c2e5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16480673", "id": "16480673", "price": 160, "review": "Super s\u00e9jour chez Elodie, l'appartement est tr\u00e8s bien situ\u00e9 dans un quartier tr\u00e8s vivant.\nElodie nous a conseill\u00e9 pleins de bonnes adresses.\nL'appartement est id\u00e9al pour 2-3 personnes."}
