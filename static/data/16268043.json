{"description": "My apartment is close to Prospect Park, the F and G trains subway, Barb\u00e8s, Colson Patisserie, the 9th st YMCA. It's bright, quiet, kid-friendly -- a perfect place to spend the Easter holidays. Cable-TV, fast-wifi, washer-dryer included. Ideally looking for someone to take property from April 7-28, since I will be in Cuba then.\n\nAll rooms in the apartment.\n\nPark Slope is one of the most fun and safe neighborhoods in NYC.\n\nVery close to the F and G trains (Seventh avenue stop), which means Manhattan is only 15-20 mins away.", "name": "Bright, quiet 2-bed apt in prime Park Slope", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4a144e15-ac69-40f3-a17a-9a6e6478468a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16268043", "id": "16268043", "price": 125, "review": "Beautiful place equipped with all amenities and in the center of everthing and just minutes away from the subway , restaurants and stores.
