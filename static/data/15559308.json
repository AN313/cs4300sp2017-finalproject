The location was superb. Aristides' place was very homey and welcoming. It kinda reminded me of my own place. Comfortable beds, room darkening shades and an inviting shower made our weekend so pleasant and a much deserved respite from our daily lives. I loved being able to walk everywhere. Williamsburg has so much to offer and Aristides' place is the perfect location. There is a beer hall right across the street so it can get lively in the evening but the noise was never enough to keep us up. I just loved the private patio. It is an incredible advantage to have green space in this area. Being able to walk to Blue Bottle orToby's Estate for coffee in the mornings, Martha's Country Bakery for dessert, Joe's for late night pizza was a treat for us. With a Whole Foods around the corner and a bevy of restaurants and shops within walking distance, this place is top-notch! I definitely look forward to coming back and if this place is available, I would absolutely book again."}
