{"description": "The apartment is at the third floor of a renovated brownstone in the heart of Bed-Stuy, a fascinating neighborhood -- up-and-coming while but with a true sense of community.  \n\nTwo bedrooms with full-sized beds, closets and big windows that get direct morning sunshine. There's also a double-sized futon in the living room. \n\nThere are plentiful coffee shops, fancy bars, nice restaurants. It's close to the C train at Kingston-Throop which brings you directly to Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan.", "name": "COZY APARTMENT FULL OF LIGHT IN BED-STUY", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7dcf42b5-626b-4dc6-9528-bd90b77a8370.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16244121", "id": "16244121", "price": 191, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival.
