{"description": "Sunny and cozy apartment right in front of the Prospect Park. Plenty of bars and coffee shops around. It's close to Manhattan (20 min. on the train) and it's in the same block that the subway station. Plenty of restaurants and bars and a safe area. . You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Sunny and cozy One bedroom apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/017f94ac-381e-4cc5-bff8-72a2cf12a282.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15918862", "id": "15918862", "price": 100, "review": "Marta's home was just like the picture. Clean, bright, cozy, and very accessible to great places in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Worked great for four people--privacy for two couples and the neighborhood was welcoming with coffee and markets and pie nearby!"}
