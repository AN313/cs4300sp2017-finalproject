Asunto sijaitsee Brooklynin Brownstone -talon kellarikerroksessa erill\u00e4\u00e4n perheen tiloista. Asuntoon on oma sis\u00e4\u00e4nk\u00e4ynti ja talo on hiljainen, vaikka naapurissa sijaitsee perhep\u00e4iv\u00e4hoitola. Kaikki toimi moitteettomasti ja asunnossa on juuri remontoitu kylpyhuone. Vuodevaatteet ja pyyhkeet olivat laadukkaita. Metro on k\u00e4velymatkan p\u00e4\u00e4ss\u00e4, mutta ei kuitenkaan ihan l\u00e4hell\u00e4. Kannattaa pit\u00e4\u00e4 metrokarttaa aina mukana ja hankkia metrokortti. Varsinaista ruokakauppaa ei ole l\u00e4hettyvill\u00e4, mutta pieni\u00e4 marketteja, kahviloita ja ravintoloita on joka nurkalla. Asunnossa ei ole mahdollisuutta ruuanlaittoon, mutta mikro l\u00f6ytyy. Mark pit\u00e4\u00e4 hyv\u00e4n huolen vuokralaisistaan ja auttaa mielell\u00e4\u00e4n, joten suosittelemme t\u00e4t\u00e4 paikkaa l\u00e4mpim\u00e4sti(URL HIDDEN)"}
