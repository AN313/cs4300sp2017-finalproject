{"description": "My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Groceries stores near by, a laundromat and steps away from subway/train station, with very friendly locals. You will be staying in an area of Brooklyn called Cypress Hills. It's a neighborhood community part of East New York. It's not full of tourists & famous monuments like Manhattan. You'd have to take public transit, the train station is 1minute away, or taxi/cab, Uber, or Lyft to get to those places.\n\nA cute decorative one bedroom apartment for your stay in Brooklyn. Can accommodate 2 and you will have the whole apartment to yourself for your lodging in NYC. If you want to experience the heart of Brooklyn and stay at a convenient Airbnb, this is the place!\n\nAfter your Airbnb booking, you will receive the phone number. The host is available to respond to all your needed questions, via Airbnb or phone contact.\n\nThere is a Latin restaurant a block away and a cute night club, if you like night clubbing.\n\nNo need to try and find the subway/train station, it will be right there, only steps away from the apartment.", "name": "Cute Decorative Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/36c9903f-d29f-494b-8a10-4471cb722a4f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14809727", "id": "14809727", "price": 75, "review": "Edvige was very welcoming and easy to communicate with.
