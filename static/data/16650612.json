{"description": "Chic studio apartment in the perfect Midtown location. Next door to endless restaurant options, down the street from all of the Broadway theatres, and a short walk to Times Square or Columbus Circle and Central Park. Next to the ACE train makes it easy to get anywhere in the city. Full kitchen access with brand new appliances and a beautiful, clean all marble bathroom. Feel free to enjoy the record player!", "name": "CHIC, UPSCALE STUDIO-MIDTOWN, PERFECT LOCATION!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43d4f821-3b49-455d-bc30-7d75ed57daf4.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16650612", "id": "16650612", "price": 200, "review": "Unbeatable location"}
