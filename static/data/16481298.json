The house is quite clean and very confortable, cozy for two or three people. There are all the amenities you will need for a quick meal. Stuff is new and very clean. The stairs are not so  challenging, even with a large lugage. Most important, the ouse is close to subway linse 123 and ace, making easy to reach every spott in NYC. There are a lot of cool pkaces and bars nearby. Chelsea market is a great place to eat. You will apreciate the peace in this building. Only one problem: there is a kind of wather tube that make little noise somewhen in the night for few minutes. If you are  going for a peacefull sleep and do not use earplugs maybe you will be scarried during your dreams. Bythaway Alex provides earplugs.\n"}
