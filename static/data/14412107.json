I contacted Jonn to ask whether it was possible for us to stay an extra night early and he organised it with Daren from the bar downstairs to let us in, perfect!\nThe apartment is large, spacious, clean and modern. Please note there is no TV, which was a welcome relief to us!\nIt is located a short walk from the Subway with a line going direct to Manhattan.\nThe surrounding area is quiet with a selection of good restaurants, bars and coffee shops.\nThe apartment is above a great bar which is owned by Jonn, we visited a couple of times for cocktails. Please be aware that the music can be heard inside the flat. Even though it didn't bother us, there was a jar of ear plugs in the kitchen drawer!\nCommunication was excellent from Jonn and often replied to messages almost instantly. Great host!\nI'd definitely stay again when I return to New York in the future."}
