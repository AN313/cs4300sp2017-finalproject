Takes about 20mins to get to most main areas near Central Park. About 40mins to get to ferries to Staten Island and Statue of Liberty. Even though the house is alongside the subway, as shown in the photo, but we were pleasantly surprised that the noise wasn't a problem at all and we slept well.\nThe house was warm (we stayed in early Spring) and very clean and tidy. Nice furnishings and well equipped kitchen with dishwasher. Futon in lounge is comfortable and the lounge can be a private bedroom too as it can be closed off from the other areas of the house. It was a great place for my mum and me to stay for our first NYC holiday. "}
