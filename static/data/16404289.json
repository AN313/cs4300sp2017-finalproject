{"description": "Our home is within walking distance to Columbia University, Central Park, A,B,C,D, 2 & 3 Subway stations and many restaurants and shops. It is well suited for couples traveling together and families (with kids). It is available for New Year's week of Dec 26th through Jan 2. We hope to rent it for the entire week for $1200. Our adult son or daughter will be occupying a bedroom on the second floor but the rest of the place is yours to use for the week of Dec. 26th through the morning of Jan. 2nd.\n\nThis is a beautiful 3 story brownstone in the historic community of Harlem with great transportation to all NYC including a simple 20 minute subway ride to Times Square in order to celebrate the New Year!\n\nYou will have access to the entire place except for one room.\n\nThere is great transportation from our home with access to all of NYC.  The A,B,C,D,2 & 3 subway trains are just a few minutes walk from our front door.", "name": "Brownstone on a tree-lined street in NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1d866f6e-4f1a-48ea-b98a-fc2a1358bcc1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16404289", "id": "16404289", "price": 200, "review": "Short walk to subway lines B and D.  Good supermarket nearby. Also walking distance to Levain Bakery (well known for their cookies, at this location there are no line ups unlike the Amsterdam location).  Easy to find street parking. On a quiet residential street.  Jeff's home was very comfortable, spacious and clean for our family of 5.  Did not meet Jeff but very easy communication with him and his son was at the house to welcome us.  Thank you for the chocolates - a nice welcoming gift."}
