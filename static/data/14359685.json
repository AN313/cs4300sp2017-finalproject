The appartment was very well located and comfortable enough to fit 4 people. We used the air matress instead of the couch for two of us, and it was very comfortable. Good quality/price rate for Manhattan.\n\n\u00e9ramos 4 personas en viaje de turismo. El apartamento est\u00e1 muy bien situado y suficientemente c\u00f3modo para 4 personas.
