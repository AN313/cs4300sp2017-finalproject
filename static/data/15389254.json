{"description": "**Please note I've recently moved to this location, but have 25 5-star reviews from previous property**\n\nWelcome to the Upper East Side!  My apartment is located in a perfect location - close to restaurants, bars, Museum Mile, Central Park, and Gracie Mansion.  To get downtown, you're 2 minute walk from the new 2nd Avenue line and a 5 minute walk from the 4,5,6 line, which will put you downtown in 15 minutes.  Excited to have you stay!", "name": "Entire 1 bed Apt - steps to Central Park & The Met", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8909dd82-0057-4dd0-b679-f1b48ff125df.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15389254", "id": "15389254", "price": 115, "review": "Jocelyn's place is in a great location close to Central Park and museum mile! The subway is very close and offers you a straight shot downtown without having to switch trains. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, cafes, and anything else you would need easily within walking distance.\n\nJocelyn has a super nice and cosy place with a cute living room with TV access, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Also, Thompson is probably the friendliest cat we have ever met!\n\nWe had no issues with the place, and would certainly recommend it for those looking for a great place to stay in Manhatten!"}
