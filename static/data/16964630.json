{"description": "This cozy, unique studio is nestled in the heart of Carroll Gardens,where you'll be able to experience the best of both old and new Brooklyn, from local cafes and neighborhood shops to hip bars and five star restaurants (Lucali, Buttermilk Channel and Frankie's are within a few blocks). The F and G subway lines allow for quick, easy access to all areas of the city. The apartment itself is adorable and provides the perfect jumping off point for both solo travel and romantic getaways.\n\nThis small studio has everything you need. It has excellent light and provides a cozy place to rest after a day in Manhattan or Brooklyn. The kitchen is equipped with plenty of fridge space, plates, utensils, pots and pans. The table seats two people comfortably, or can be used as a work space. The bathroom is quite large with a full bathtub and great water pressure. There's ample drawer and closet space for storage, and a very comfortable couch.\n\nYou'll have the place to yourself.\n\nI'll be available, so don't hesitate to reach out. I've lived in NYC for 10 years and love providing restaurant, bar, cafe and site recommendations. I can give subway directions to anywhere you need to go and answer any questions you might have.\n\nCarroll Gardens is steeped in rich Italian history and culture, and in recent years has become a hot spot for trendy bars, restaurants and coffee shops. This melding of old and new Brooklyn culture creates the perfect neighborhood for anyone looking to explore but also relax. It's one of the greenest neighborhoods you'll find in Brooklyn with its unique front yards and grand brownstones. It's adjacent to the up-and-coming hipster neighborhoods of Gowanus and Red Hook, but is also very family friendly and boasts a broad range of locals from varying backgrounds. I've lived all over Manhattan and Brooklyn and find this to be one of the most charming areas in all of NYC.\n\nThe apartment is a seven minute walk from the F and G trains. The F will take you straight into downtown in Manhattan in less than 20 minutes, and to most other areas of Manhattan without needing to transfer lines. The G will take you to most other areas of Brooklyn including downtown Brooklyn, Fort Greene, Bed Stuy, Williamsburg and Greenpoint as well as Long Island City. Cabs are also readily available on Clinton Street.", "name": "Cheerful, Sunny Carroll Gardens Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/af83a986-72e8-4e3f-bb5a-937b5eacaa64.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16964630", "id": "16964630", "price": 96, "review": "Nice studio.
