{"description": "My place is close to World Trade Center, Brookfield Place, and 9/11 Memorial and Museum. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the views, sunlight, happiness, great energy, well designed apartment by a designer. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with kids). It's a true one bedroom with a great layout.\n\nGreat light and views\n\nAll subway lines are here.", "name": "Quiet 1 bedroom with water views downtown NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d8544728-db68-46cd-a4e5-348ae04941f7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15864683", "id": "15864683", "price": 150, "review": "We had such a fantastic time at this river-facing apartment! The best thing of course is the view - Hudson river from one side, and One World Tower from the other! We took so many photos and videos just from our windows! Location is perfect, 5 min from the Subway, and a line of cabs downstairs. There are lots of restaurants and Le District french supermarket downstairs.\n\nNow about the apartment - we really enjoyed clean and creative interior design. Lots of works of art, and still very spacious, with a lot of sunlight. Everything was provided, the kitchen is fully stocked. Everything was very thoughtful (e.g. extra towels and sheets). And even Hemp Organic Soap for washing dishes in the kitchen! \n\nOur host was very responsive on emails and messages, and she was very helpful with resolving our questions (e.g. she even emailed the management to let us get our shopping deliveries). \n\nWe will definitely stay here when we come back to NYC, and will recommend to our friends.  Thank you dear Ekta for being a gracious host. "}
