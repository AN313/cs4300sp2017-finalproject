It's compact, which is usual for this location, and the location is excellent and very close to several subway lines. Michael's communication was excellent and the check-in process went smoothly despite my flight being delayed several hours. Just a couple small things to be aware of -- the front door key is tricky, and you have to pull it out almost a quarter inch for it to catch; and if you're more than six feet tall you won't really have room to stretch out in bed. All in all, I had a good stay. Thanks, Michael!"}
