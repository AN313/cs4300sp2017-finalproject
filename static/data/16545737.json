It was very clean and tidy, and the location could not have been better. We were minutes from Times Square and there were several restaurants, coffee shops, and convenience stores within a block or two.  The building was beautiful and felt very safe, and the rooftop access was a nice touch with beautiful views, although the apartment itself had some decent views as well. Anything we could have needed was available including a fully stocked kitchen and plenty of extra blankets. There was enough room to sleep 3-5 guests and there were plenty of entertainment options on the Smart TV. Our stay was very comfortable and we would definitely try to book this apartment again the next time we stay in NYC.\nCheers!"}
