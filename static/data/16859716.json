{"description": "Comfortable apartment on 3rd floor with double bed, living room, well-stocked kitchen and good light. Apartment faces back of building, so no street noise to wake you up in the morning*\n\nBedford Stuyvesant is one of the most beautiful old neighborhoods in NYC. Within a short walk from the apartment are all of the old brownstone neighborhoods and all of the great new bars and restaurants.\n\n*see notes\n\nYou have access to the whole apartment.\n\nThere's a great supermarket and 24 hour laundromat on the block, and within 1 block there's a nice cafe (Burly), specialty wine store with frequent tastings (Vin de Table) and in June a popular Bushwick Arepa spot will be arriving (Guacuco). You'll be equidistant from great Bushwick Broadway venues like Bizarre Bar, Skytown, Happyfun Hideway and all the great Bedford/Nostrand night life (Do or Dive, Dynaco, Black Swan, Fancy Nancy, etc).\n\nIt's a 10 to 15 min walk to the J/M and G trains from my apartment, and there are buses right outside my door and around the corner that go to Greenpoint and Clinton Hill.\n\nFor those that prefer biking, I'm right on the Dekalb bike route, and there's a CitiBike station 2 blocks from the apartment for easy bike rental.\n\n*There is a commercial space on the ground floor (2 floors down) that gets rented for events 2 or 3 nights per week, usually on the weekend. On those nights, you can hear the music in the apartment - audible but not crazy loud - from 8pm to around 2am. Those that are bothered by such things should consider other options.", "name": "Sunny Bed-Stuy Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/75ceb5b2-657e-42b5-ab2e-a93709b72175.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16859716", "id": "16859716", "price": 40, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival.
