{"description": "My place is centrally located on a GORGEOUS tree-lined block, steps from Central Park, high-end retail, great coffee shops, Equinox, Trader Joes, Lincoln Center, and much more! Steps from 1/2/3 and B/C trains. I love my apartment and am happy to share my home to the right person or couple who will treat it like their own.  Preference for someone looking to rent Mon-Thurs or the whole week.  No pets, please.  Email me with any questions!   My place is good for couples and business travelers.", "name": "Upper West Side Sanctuary Chic", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f97a1a6c-6b5f-4467-a1da-f710fe4102d5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14278771", "id": "14278771", "price": 250, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival.
