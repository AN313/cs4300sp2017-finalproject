{"description": "This apartment is in the perfect location: the block ends in Prospect Park and there's a subway stop on the convenient B/Q line just across the street. It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood near museums, Barclay's Center, and Manhattan. I am a long time host with lots of good reviews. I am traveling over Thanksgiving, putting up my whole apartment for the first time.", "name": "Neat and Massive on Prospect Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2041bdeb-bc72-402f-982b-9a49cfb47d26.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15988992", "id": "15988992", "price": 151}
