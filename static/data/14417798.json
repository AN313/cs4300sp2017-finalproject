The apartment is very convenient to multiple Subway stops and is easy to get around from. It IS an efficiency apartment and a walk-up, but that's the charm of Manhattan and living the NY life for a week. I should mention that the bed is very firm - I'm a fan, but I know not everyone is. Everything was very clean and organized and Kris was great at communicating at appropriate times, we were never bothered. I highly recommend their place!"}
