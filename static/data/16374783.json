{"description": "Welcome to our Brooklyn sanctuary. This loft apartment is quiet, bright, and full of plants. It's conveniently located just a block from the A/C line and 20 minutes to downtown Manhattan.  \n\nWhen you're not cooking in the spacious kitchen, you can explore the excellent soul food at Peaches HotHouse and the Royal Rib House.  Want something healthier?  Check out Eugene & Company or breakfast at Cozy Coffee.  In the evening have a drink at Bed-Vyne Brew and Doris.\n\nThis is a two-story spacious open concept apartment with a skylight.  The bedroom and bathroom are upstairs.\n\nThe apartment is above the A/C subway line.  You will feel it rumbling by. Don\u2019t worry it won\u2019t take long before you don't notice it anymore.\n\nYou will have little to no contact with me.  When you're visiting, I am usually traveling.  I might welcome you and give you the keys.\n\nThe A/C line is a short block away.", "name": "Loft in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ebb12c16-8818-47aa-b7dc-3cab2b63efc5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16374783", "id": "16374783", "price": 100, "review": "If I could give 6 out of 5 stars I would! The pictures are absolutely a perfect representation of the place. Everything is perfect and the location is amazing. Shauna is so great at communicating with the guests. Even on her weekend away, she was on call the whole time so if we had problems getting into the door because the lock was a little stubborn, we called her. It was a great stay and great location! Definitely one of my best stays though airbnb! I'll be sure to try and find this listing again when I'm in the area! The value was also amazing!!!!! "}
