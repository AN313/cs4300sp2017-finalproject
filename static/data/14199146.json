{"description": "My place is close to Ox Cart Tavern, Milk And Honey Cafe, Coffee Mob, Sycamore Bar and many bars, restaurants and markets. \n\nThe apartment is quite cozy and clean. The F train is a 5-6 minute walk away and the Q train is 15 minutes away on foot. Manhattan is 30 minutes away via subway. Prospect Park is one mile away and Coney Island beach is four miles away. The apartment is along a major bike path for those who enjoy bike riding. There is laundry in the building.\n\nThe apartment is available from August 15-December 15 and my preference would be to rent it to one person during that entire time. Thank you.", "name": "Cozy & Spacious Studio in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c1cd2726-9d52-4df0-91ba-c4d3a99ba70d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14199146", "id": "14199146", "price": 55}
