{"description": "My place is close to JFK international airport  (10 minute ride), Laguardia airport  (20 minute ride), parks, dining, and transportation. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the coziness, lovely dinners when host cooks, cleanliness, exceptional safety (with surveillance cameras 24/7). My place is a basement studio apartment in a house, with your own private entrance,  good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Enjoy premium cable channels, free WiFi and great dinners!\n\nYou will have your own private entrance to the basement studio apartment, minus kitchen.  There is a refrigerator and freezer where you can store food, and dinner is served (if desired) by homeowner, who happens to be a caterer specializing in several different cuisines\n\nInteraction is up to you. I can give direction, suggestions, dinners every night if needed. However,if privacy is what's desired, I do respect  everyone's personal space. Communication may be kept solely through text.\n\nQuiet neighborhood, about 10 minute ride from JFK airport.  The people are friendly, and this is a middle  working class community.\n\nThere is public transportation  via bus 1 block away. There is also a long island railroad nearby that will take you into NYC in 20 minutes. There is free street parking if are driving. Just be mindful not to block any of the neighbor's driveways.", "name": "Cozy Studio w/ free WiFi, premium cable, near JFK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/184200ed-ab6b-44f1-9fd0-edc3607318d2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14636181", "id": "14636181", "price": 85, "review": "Darlene is a great host!
