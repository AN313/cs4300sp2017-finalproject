{"description": "Great apartment in the best location of downtown Manhattan. Enjoy the stylish Soho neighborhood, the endless boutique cafes, and shops. The apartment is located in Soho and just a few minutes walk to major subway lines. Windows to the apartment face inward and away from the street so you can relax in a city that never sleeps. The apartment has just been renovated with stainless steel kitchen appliances, new hardwood floors, and new furniture. Come and experience the true New York.", "name": "Great apartment! The best location in Manhattan!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/eee86a33-98d8-4c56-963f-674ec3705c9b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15974252", "id": "15974252", "price": 139, "review": "This was our first Airbnb stay and it could not have been better. Emanuel was a perfect host - very accessible, helpful, responsive and accommodating, even from afar! Getting the keys was incredibly easy and trouble-free. Emanuel's place was immaculately clean, welcoming and comfortable - it seemed almost brand new. It is in a great location, just as he describes it - a few minutes from 3 different subway lines and within short walking distance to Soho, Nolita, Chinatown, Little Italy and the Lower East Side. We were able to easily and quickly get to anywhere in the city by subway or walking from his place. Emanuel made sure we felt at home in his home, with plenty of space to unpack and put our clothes away while there. It was a great experience without any problems or difficulties and I would absolutely stay there again and recommend Emanuel's place to other Airbnbers. The one thing that should be noted is that, like so many NYC apartments, it is in a walk-up only building, so it may not be the right fit for someone who might have difficulty climbing up a few flights of stairs with luggage. Otherwise, perfect!"}
