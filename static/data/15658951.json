{"description": "My place is in the most popular social scene in Manhattan!  100's of restaurants including the famous Restaurant Row. Times Square and all subway lines to get you anywhere in the city you could possibly dream of. Rockefeller Center where the Rockefeller Christmas Tree is located for the holidays. Hudson River where the Intrepid is docked. Central Park, Lincoln Center, Upper West Side, The High Line built on the elevated freight rail.  You can't beat this location! All within 10 min walk!\n\nThe apartment is very clean and the kitchen is stocked.  The building is very quiet an dI have the best neighbors.  The roof top deck is my favorite thing about the building.  The views are stunning of Midtown Manhattan and Times Square.\n\nYou will have the entire place to yourself and the closet and bathroom are completely empty for your use.  The roof top deck is open with key access and is only open until 10PM.  No exceptions.\n\nI will be happy to help you with any questions you may have before and during your stay.   I have lived in the area for almost 20 years and I know the area very well..\n\nAll subway lines are with in a 10 minute walk to get anywhere in the city in about a half hour.  There are so many things within walking distance which is kinder on the wallet that you can't find a better location.", "name": "Beautiful sanctuary in the heart of the Big Apple", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cf4ca699-000e-4730-ab9c-48a2e6ba4717.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15658951", "id": "15658951", "price": 150, "review": "Very good position near to restaurants and subway, also very good if u re working at the javits center/ good wifi and nice apt / "}
