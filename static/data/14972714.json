{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of the location.  You can explore the best of Harlem--the jazz, the history and the food--but you're just a 15 minute train ride to midtown. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), and the perfect New York getaway.", "name": "Beautiful + convenient 2 bedroom Harlem townhouse", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/825fac35-d788-401c-833a-d567f110a478.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14972714", "id": "14972714", "price": 195, "review": "This is a lovely apartment.  At the time of our visit there was no microwave, so be prepared to cook on the stove or oven if you are into left-overs or ready-made meals.  Or perhaps there will be a microwave in the future. It was great the there were a few items like sugar and coffee left for us to use - it was very helpful that we did not have to stock the whole kitchen for our visit.  George is a lovely host and was very helpful on all fronts. Thanks again!"}
