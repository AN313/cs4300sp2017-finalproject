{"description": "Literally the best location in the heart of the celebrity favorite West Village. Within short walking distance to all of downtown (Greenwich Village, SoHo, Chelsea + The Highline, East Village, Tribeca, LES).\n\nMajor subway lines connecting to all parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn very close by. Subway lines: 1.2,3, A, C, E, B, D, F, M", "name": "Studio in the Heart of the West Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4a9e0236-f7f8-46f1-bed8-50a3cb450eb6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14552533", "id": "14552533", "price": 129, "review": "This is a very typical West Village apartment. It's tiny, but a great place to lay your head after a long day in the city. I travel to New York monthly for work and this is one of my favorite places I've stayed there. It's super walkable, close to useful train stations, and very neighborhoody. The bed was comfy and everything was spotless. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you're trying to cook all your meals at the apartment, but who would want to do that when the city has so much good food to offer? :)"}
