{"description": "This is a great little apartment in the heart of the Lower East Side, close to all the caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars and a short walk to Soho, Nolita and the East Village\n\nIt's very cosy, everything works perfectly and there is everything you need including a fully equipped kitchen. \n\nThe apartment is a 5th floor walk-up in a typical LES brick building. The area gets lively at night, especially at week-ends, so be warned if you are a light sleeper - or join the crowds and go out!\n\nThere are washers and dryers in the building ($2 each to use).\n\nThis is a really fun neighborhood, and a short walk to Chinatown, Soho and the East and West Villages. I have very much enjoyed exploring the area and would love to give you recommendations.\n\nThe apartment is right next to subway lines which can take you anywhere in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. We are only 1 stop away from Greenpoint or Williamsburg - or on a nice day, a lovely 20 minute walk over the bridge.", "name": "Lovely 1 BR in the Lower East Side", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a5a6890-c9e7-4fb3-84fc-5281faf3f6a7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16943845", "id": "16943845", "price": 124, "review": "We had a fantastic stay at Coralie's apartment. The apartment was clean and beautifully decorated. The location could not be better in terms of getting anywhere else in the city as well as being steps away from fantastic bars and restaurants. She left a list of her favorite nearby eateries/bars/activities which was super helpful. The artwork and decorations gave the apartment a really warm, homey feeling.  Coralie was very communicative before, during, and after our stay to make sure that everything went as smoothly as possible. If anybody is looking to stay in New York, I would highly recommend Coralie's place."}
