The place is bigger than the pictures show and very comfortable. Close to metro, target and 7/11, but not really walking distance to the inner city.\nThe only negative is that it was a bit noisy at night, as the apartment is right above a restaurant, it wasn't that big a deal for us, as three 20 y/o's, but maybe if you're travelling with small children it could be slight problem. \nEven so, we would definitely recommend it!"}
