She was very sweet and helpful from helping us with our luggage, to helping us figure out where to eat. She was excellent with communication as well. \n\nThe apartment itself was quaint and clean. We had access to a lot of dishes and cookware if we needed to. We felt very comfortable in her apartment. It is also only a couple blocks from the subway which was super helpful. \n\n10/10 would recommend. It made our experience in the city super great and was really affordable as well."}
