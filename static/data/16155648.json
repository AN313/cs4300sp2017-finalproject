{"description": "Located in the heart of Bushwick between the L and the JMZ, we've made our home a fun retreat set in a classic Brooklyn railroad. The apartment is just steps from countless neighborhood bars & restaurants, and has a bright and spacious bedroom, cozy living room, great (big!) kitchen, and the 'flower' room (our little work room/guest room that can be appointed with a deluxe air bed for additional guests).\n\nWe'd have to meet up before check in so I can pass off the spare set of keys.\n\n....like most legit Bushwick apartments, it comes with a small quirk! The bathroom has just a shower/tub and a toilet (someone forgot the sink!)....not as bad as it sounds though! We just wash our hands in the tub or the nearby kitchen sink :)", "name": "Unique Retreat in the Heart of Bushwick!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9927519e-cd1d-4b52-8210-72649759bd26.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16155648", "id": "16155648", "price": 140}
