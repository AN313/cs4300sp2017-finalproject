{"description": "500 square foot studioSteps from subway (6 train), Central Park, food store and museum mile. Located on Lexington Ave, there's tons of restaurants. Perfect for a couple. I have a queen size bed and lots of light. The apartment is in a walk up, 2nd floor. My building is very simple.But my apartment has a clean modern mid century design anyone would be envious of! I have many authentic eames designs and other antiques from the 1950'\n\nClose to subway\n\nYes! The bus and 6 six and steps away", "name": "Studio, 2 blocks from Central Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c477487c-94cf-4799-a537-f52641236620.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15935748", "id": "15935748", "price": 90, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 218 days before arrival.
