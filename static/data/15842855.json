{"description": "Note that this apartment is unfurnished, despite the photos. I'll provide an inflated air mattress and pump, sheets and towels, bathroom essentials and wifi. The rest is up to you! The apartment is in a great location, convenient to Prospect Park, Park Slope and the subway to Manhattan. It's a lovely south facing, sunny apartment in a new elevator building with a gym and a roof deck.  It's a great place for a barebones stay in NYC. Good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Unfurnished Apartment for your stay in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/88e1f6fd-96b7-45f3-9442-d57eae22bd27.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15842855", "id": "15842855", "price": 100}
