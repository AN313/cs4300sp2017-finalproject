The neighborhood has many advantages including proximity to both Central Park and the Hudson River Park, culture (including Lincoln Center and the Museum of Natural History), and a family-friendly atmosphere that is great for kids and strollers.\n\nThe neighborhood is perfect for people that like to be active. Take a run around the Central Park reservoir, bike through Central Park, play baseball or football on the Great Lawn or roller blade along the Hudson.\n\nThe neighborhood is also perfect for the gastronomically active that like good food and a drink or two. Grabbing some greasy food and a drink at the Boat Basin is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. The upscale Time Warner Center has a collection of great restaurants. Similarly, the food around Lincoln Center is fantastic.\n\nToday, the Upper West Side is upscale and primarily residential. The population is around 150,000. Shops are abundant up and down Broadway and throughout the neighborhood. Lincoln Center, The Beacon Theatre, and The New York City Ballet are among the neighborhood's renowned landmarks. The rest of the neighborhood is scattered with caf\u00e9s, coffee shops, movie theatres, bars, and restaurants. Some noteworthy restaurants include: Jean-Georges, Calle Ocho, and Caf\u00e9 Lalo (featured in the 1998 film, You've Got Mail).\n\nSubway options include the 1/2/3 and A&C trains, which make several stops along the Upper West Side. There are also five different bus routes: the M5 runs from north to south on Riverside Drive, the M104 runs north to south on Broadway, the M7/M11 runs north on Amsterdam and south on Columbus, the M10 runs north and south on Central Park West, and crosstown buses run at every major intersection.\n\nPlease check the reviews on my profile to read more about the experience my guests have when I am hosting them :)\n\nIt's the Topfloor of a Walk up building (5 flights up!)...just to consider if you have troubles walking up stairs.", "name": "Private Apartment steps from Central Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16c3bc64-2fc2-4a80-b73d-46ad3ed1eb15.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17040247", "id": "17040247", "price": 250}
