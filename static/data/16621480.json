{"description": "Amazing, bright, and sunny studio in Washington heights. This is a perfect space for a solo traveler or a couple. It is an elevator building with laundry service a couple doors down.  It has 1 FULL bed and 1 single aero mattress available. It has a small but renovated kitchen, refrigerator, and bath tub. The studio is a few steps from the 1, A,C trains and I can leave maps for any place you want to go. The edge hotel is across the street and Columbia Presbyterian one block away.", "name": "Studio in the heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5414dc01-4eac-4832-ae33-f7946d97af2a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16621480", "id": "16621480", "price": 70, "review": "My husband and I came and stayed in Rachel's apartment for a week. We loved our stay here. Easy to access the subway. Tons of places to grab groceries and a Starbucks around the corner. Would definitely stay here again!"}
