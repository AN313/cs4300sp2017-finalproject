{"description": "My modern and chic, 1 bedroom apartment is in the PERFECT hip neighborhood! My place is on a gorgeous, tree-lined street and is incredibly close to major attractions, world-class nightlife, and art destinations. Located in a nice and safe area like West Chelsea you'll find Great restaurants, bars & art galleries, all walking distance. A cab to Times Square, Freedom Tower, Empire State Building are all a hand wave or a whistle away. You can get all around quickly, subways 24H going to everywhere.\n\nYou will have access to the whole apartment\n\nI will be around via text or email throughout your stay\n\nMy Apartment is close to all major subway lines to 14th street\n1,2,3 trains(just around the corner)\nF,M train(one avenue away)\nA,C,E,L trains(one avenue away)\nand all other remaining subway lines are about a 5-6 minute walk to Union Square\n\nPlease note that this is a 4th floor walk up. if you have no issues climbing a few stairs then come on up!\n\nAlso, although you have a private bathroom while staying at my place, you should be aware that it is adjacent to the main entrance of the apartment. At one point the penthouse was converted into two separate apartments leaving the bathroom next door. You'll have to get out of the unit in order to use your private bathroom. I also leave a key to the bathroom just in case you want to leave your valuables and lock it.\n\nIts an old railroad apartment building, so the radiator sometimes makes a bit of a sound while heating up. \nIf you are going to be doing some cooking, please let me know if you need other type of cooking utensils. I can provide them upon request.", "name": "Modern and Chic Apartment in the heart of Chelsea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/575e36b4-0007-40ab-ad42-2ed95b15c6c7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16016486", "id": "16016486", "price": 130, "review": "We had a great stay.
