{"description": "Our apartment is located right in the heart of the Bay Ridge action. One block from the R train ,which can get you to the Barclay Center in 15 minutes or Manhattan in 25. However I do suggest staying locally. We are located right off 86th street which is full of shopping and on 3rd ave which is full of  bars and restaurants. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location, the views, the people, and the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Cozy , Cute and Spacious one bedroom Brooklyn Apt", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/00b8a91e-d592-4d37-b435-c554e9bb9056.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15542745", "id": "15542745", "price": 90}
