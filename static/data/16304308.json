{"description": "2 Blocks from Times Square, but on a nice, quiet block. Close to 8th & 9th Ave, Amy's Bread, all Broadway Theatres, EVERY Subway. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the coziness, the light, and the privacy. (It is not a share.) My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "PRIVATE Studio Apt 2 Blocks from X Square/Quiet!!!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b23ee06b-c513-44ad-b49e-f753c3ab4e77.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16304308", "id": "16304308", "price": 250, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival.
