Ryan and Ayanna  were extremely helpful and friendly. They were fast with their responses and flexible with requests. The apartment is located in a nice safe locale with plenty of South Asian eateries and stores around. We loved that it was a short metro ride to Manhattan. The apartment is tastefully furnished and had all the amenities advertised. We would definitely recommend this apartment."}
