{"description": "Our modern, newly renovated and well furnished (and decorated) apartment is located in the heart of West Harlem. 1 block form the 2/3 subway line and just a few blocks from 125th street! Secure (intercom and FOB key system) and comfortable (we actually live here) this is my favorite apartment I've ever lived in while living in NYC (10+ years).  We're available for any questions you may have or if you need advice on where to go and what to do while in NYC.

It was a only couple of blocks away from the subway and close to a lot of historical sites in Harlem. Be prepared to bring your luggage up the stairs. There's a lot but they're definitely manageable. Other than that I have no complaints. Christina was such a sweetheart and made sure we had a comfortable stay! The bed was so comfy and the shower was lovely!"}
