{"description": "My place is close to The Hudson River, in the heart of West Village, with cafes and restaurants galore.  It's next to the 1-train on 7th Avenue, walking distance to water, The Village, Meat Packing and Soho. You\u2019ll love my place because it IS huge, has the best rooftop 360 views of NYC, it's nestled in the most fun neighborhood in NYC with celebrity sitings on a regular basis. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Huge 1-bedroom Loft in West Village w/ 360 Rooftop", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a22a5293-5342-49dd-a7e1-9e5ec32fad5b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14169689", "id": "14169689", "price": 249, "review": "Maura's place is the perfect location!
