{"description": "My place is close to Essex Street Market, Tenement Museum, Barrio Chino, Dudley's, Schiller's and tons of other hip eateries and bars. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location, the coziness, and the beautiful contemporary art galleries and restaurants that line the street. The F,M, J, Z Metro is on the corner!! Save money on cabs and get around like a local. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.", "name": "Cozy apartment in the hippest neighborhood in NY!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fd92c65d-064b-41b2-9a6c-35f72a7dbd45.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16402623", "id": "16402623", "price": 95, "review": "Eva's place worked wonderfully for me: all amenities one needs in a flat for a business or leisure trip  New York, impeccable cleanness, coziness inside, and a vibrant neighborhood outside. Three metro lines around the corner, diverse and delicious restaurants close to the apartment (though I did not have much time to try them) was a bonus to my stay.  I also felt her responsible and honest personality --an admirable quality for hosting in a city like New York. It was easy and pleasant to communicate with her. I will very be pleased to book her flat again. "}
