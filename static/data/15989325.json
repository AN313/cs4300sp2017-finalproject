{"description": "Beautiful, sun-drenched, furnished 1 bedroom apartment in Park Slope available for monthly rental. I'm moving upstate temporarily, and looking for guests to respect and enjoy my apartment during one of the most beautiful times of the year in New York!\n\nAmazing location on a beautiful block in Park Slope's historic district. Just steps away from Grand Army Plaza and its amazing farmers' market, Prospect Park, with easy subway access to the city.\n\nGreat layout, with all south-facing windows leaving the apartment filled with sunlight all day. The apartment is on a very quiet block, and has a big tree outside the window making it a comfortable, quiet oasis in the middle of bustling Brooklyn.\n\nVery close to the B, Q, 2 and 3 subway lines for easy access to the city, and not far from the F and G trains either!", "name": "Beautiful, sun-drenched Park Slope charmer", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0afa727d-95f2-459b-847e-34f1d3463ba2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15989325", "id": "15989325", "price": 91, "review": "Had a great experience staying here.
