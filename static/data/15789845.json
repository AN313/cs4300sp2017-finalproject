My friends and I were in the city for a show so her location was perfect for a place to crash. Although the space was very minimal and sparse, we were provided with an air mattress which was convenient. The apartment is very old and not ideal if you're looking for a picturesque vacation spot. It was clean for the most part though and in a good location if you need to be near manhattan but can't afford it.\n\nThe shower was very finicky. It went from very hot to very cold multiple times and everyone with me had issues as well. There were instructions but it seems the shower just didn't want to cooperate. \n\nThe location and check in process is very confusing so be sure to get in contact with Lexy early to be aware of all that. There was no number on the door, so we had trouble finding it. Also the smart lock, which you need an app to use is very confusing and not ideal if you do not have smart phone or if you're not tech savvy. \n\nOverall, we had a few minor inconveniences but it's a great spot for someone just needing a place to crash with friends.
