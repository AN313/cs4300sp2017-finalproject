{"description": "Cozy, modern apartment that's close to the vibrant restaurants and bars in Williamsburg and a short walk to the L, J, M and G trains. Fast, easy access to Manhattan (15 mins to East Village in Manhattan!)\n\nThe spacious light filled apartment is brand new (building completed construction earlier in 2016).  The space includes a bedroom, an office space (which has the 2nd bed), bathroom, fully equipped kitchen, a living room and a balcony.\n\nBeds: The bedroom has a double bed and there is a second double bed in an extra half room. However, the half room doesn't have a door. The living room also has a single day bed (it's the one by the window) and is quite comfortable.\n\nYou can access the entire apartment and balcony.\n\nWe tend to not be around for most stays, but will be available via email/phone for any questions!\n\nSubway - The Montrose Avenue L subway stop is a 5 min walk. The L line takes you to East Village in 15 minutes! The Broadway G subway stop is a 10 minute walk which connects well to other parts of Brooklyn and Queens. The Lorimer St J/M subway stop is also 10 minutes away. Because of the proximity to 4 subway lines, connectivity is GREAT! \n\nParking - There's free street parking available - it can be sometimes hard to find though. Just depends. When you park, please pay attention to street cleaning signs - the car needs to be moved during street cleaning times. Also, you have to keep 15 feet away from any fire hydrants.", "name": "Bright & spacious apartment in East Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5dbce19c-e9ee-413b-bc2a-b8f75f8785bc.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15299630", "id": "15299630", "price": 153, "review": "Incredible!! Amazing apartment with an amazing host! \nyou can clearly see how much thought, effort and time they put into designing this apartment.\nThe place was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and there is Beam projecter, Bluetooth speaker. Anu & Suyog were communicative in the days leading up to my arrival and during the course of my stay. The apartment is well located in a quiet neighbourhood, only a few blocks away from the L/G line. \nThis is the BEST airbnb experience that I've ever had. Highly recommend staying at this apartment in Williamsburg. \n\n\ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc219\uc18c \uadfc\ucc98\uc5d0 \ud799\ud55c \uce74\ud398\uc640 \ub808\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub791\uc774 \ub9ce\uace0 \uad50\ud1b5\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uae5d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc720\ub2c8\uc5b8\uc2a4\ud018\uc5b4\uae4c\uc9c0 L\ud2b8\ub808\uc778\uc744 \ud0c0\uba74 \ud55c\ubc88\uc5d0 \uac00\uc11c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubd84\ub4e4\uc774 \uac15\uc544\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0a4\uc6cc\uc11c \uac15\uc544\uc9c0\ud138\uc774 \uc870\uae08 \uc788\ub294\uac83 \ube7c\uace0\ub294 \uc778\ud14c\ub9ac\uc5b4\uba70 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\uc124\uc774 \uc0c8\uac83\uc774\uba70 \ub09c\ubc29\uacfc \uc218\ub3c4\uc2dc\uc124\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc798\ub418\uc5b4\uc788\uace0 \uac74\ubb3c\uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8 \uc548\ub41c \uc2e0\uc2dd\uac74\ubb3c\uc774\ub77c \ubcf4\uc548\ub3c4 \uc798\ub418\uc788\uace0 \uc5d8\ub9ac\ubca0\uc774\ud130\ub3c4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uce5c\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\ub3c4 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uace0 \ub2f5\ubcc0\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube60\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2f0\ube44\ub294 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uac70\ub098 usb\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba74 \ube54\ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\ud654\ub098 \uc601\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcfc\uc218\uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ube14\ub8e8\ud22c\uc2a4 \uc2a4\ud53c\ucee4\ub3c4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uc0c1\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \ub4e3\uace4 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc70c\ub9ac\uc5c4\uc2a4\ubc84\uadf8\ub098 \ube0c\ub8e8\ud074\ub9b0\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uaed8 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uace0\uc2f6\uc740 \uc219\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.
