Three stayed here quite comfortably. Although it's ground floor, it's also quiet and light. We loved sitting in the park, strolling in the neighborhood with its shops and cafes. Happy hour at Five Leaves was a highlight, as well as the aerial show at Big Sky. Da was a very communicative and responsive host."}
