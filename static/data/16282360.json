Should you need in person assistance I will contact my friend or my mother and they will be there to help you with whatever it is that you may need.\n\nWilliamsburg is one of the most happening neighborhoods in NYC. Amazing restaurants, bars, shops , murals, frequent pop-up shopping, food trucks, and super markets (wholefoods is 1\u00a0 block away). Everything you need and more is within 5 mins walk from you. After 17 years in NY I can say that this the best location in the city.\u00a0\n\nThe apartment is 1 block from the L train station (Bedford stop) which takes you to union square (downtown Manhattan) in 5 mins. There are many taxis around as well and uber's waiting time is usually never more than 3 minutes.", "name": "Beautiful - sunny loft in the HEART of Wiliamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/425028b5-7058-42a3-99f7-c466eb1de85a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16282360", "id": "16282360", "price": 275, "review": "Great experience overall.
