It is really close to a bus station (one minute walk) and the bus takes you directly to the closest Subway station, which made it easy for us to get into the city at any time without waiting for hours. The apartment itself had a great size. We stayed there with four girls. It was not too small and we had enough space for cooking and eating. \r\nJun and Janssel were super kind hosts. They checked with us a couple times during our stay if we needed anything or if they could help. They provided snacks and a folder with helpful information about the neighborhood when we arrived. \r\nAll in all we can say that our stay in NY was an unforgettable vacation, not least because of the apartment!"}
