{"description": "Off van brunt in the main stretch down to the water in redhook. Beautiful sunlight and aura in the huge loft apartment. My band mate and I are going on tour for two months. He will be coming back for some of that time but mostly will be away. We are only sir bnbing my room which is huge and almost like it's own apartment as we felt that would still allow privacy but also allow us to stay the few nights when we are in town playing shows to come back. (There are 3 bedrooms in total.)", "name": "Huge Warehouse Loft Room in Redhook", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/76c63321-a32e-44f5-b184-6a744ce43794.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16625013", "id": "16625013", "price": 103}
