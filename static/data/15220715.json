{"description": "My place is close to Pratt Institute, Fort Greene Park, G Train, The Finch (michelin star)Restaurant, The Mayflower Bar, Choice Market (the best Cafe in Clinton Hill), 750 Diner, and Emerson Bar. You\u2019ll love my place because of the high ceilings, the coziness, the sunlight, and because it is really great for weekenders, plus the location is cool... My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Super Spacious Artists Studio Loft", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6a7f59fd-4dc3-485e-afb4-b0f48467822c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15220715", "id": "15220715", "price": 150, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival.
