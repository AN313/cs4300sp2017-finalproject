{"description": "Newly renovated top-floor (3rd) studio in East Williamsburg - 20m from Union Square - featuring high ceilings, an excellent kitchen, glass shower, a 90\" projector with Apple TV and a variety of musical instruments for you to help yourself to. Short walk to the Grand or Graham L train. Blocks from Cooper Park - basketball, skate park, tennis courts, handball.\n\nGuests and friends tell me my apartment is very calming and peaceful to be in. The decor is clean and minimal. The instruments always give a wonderful gift. Feel free to create in this space.\n\nRoof access\n\nI will likely be out of town during your stay but am very available and responsive. My neighbor is on standby for any in-house needs that may arise.\n\nEast Williamsburg is located in the heart of Brooklyn's creative scene. From prime Williamsburg waterfront a stop away to Bushwick's thriving art scene and filled with delicious restaurants and bars (including Michelin rated BBQ).\n\nEasy ride on the L train to the Graham or Grand stops - just a few blocks away. The L train drops you across manhattan on 14th st gaining your easy access to any part of the island.", "name": "New reno - vibey, sun-filled studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/711b2830-c9d8-4414-8c9b-090d086bc88e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16147001", "id": "16147001", "price": 160, "review": "This spot was nice, clean, easy to find and easy to find parking.
