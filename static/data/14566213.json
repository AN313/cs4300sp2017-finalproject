{"description": "This is a Geodesic Dome--in Brooklyn.  And despite the urban setting it is a completely private oasis, reached through a hidden doorway and invisible from the street. Amenities include private outdoor space, hand-made furniture, a sauna, a vintage quadrophonic stereo system, a wood-burning stove, and, optionally (for an extra charge, with signature of a waiver, on a case-by-case basis), usage of a private pool. It is a perfect place for a couple or any adventurous person.", "name": "Geodesic Dome", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b6ff7b7b-27d1-4280-9df4-f0974c5579d0.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14566213", "id": "14566213", "price": 200, "review": "The dome was a unique experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an unconventional place to stay in Bedstuy. Perfect space for a creative retreat, and I doubt there is anything like it anywhere else in Brooklyn. Sean was great at communicating exactly what to expect, and was very flexible accommodating to our slightly hectic schedule when arriving."}
