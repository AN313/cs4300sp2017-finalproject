{"description": "Massive duplex (2bed/2bath) located near all of the action Bushwick's known for. Need to get to the city?  Manhattan's 15 minutes away on the M train a block away.  The train means there's some rumble and ear plugs will be included, but this is BROOKLYN - SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK! :)  TV, 2 queen beds, a nice open space to entertain and new appliances - enjoy this newly renovated gem! Privacy too - we stay offsite in Queens during your visit, we only see you to hand off the keys and then leave.\n\nYou only see us for the key handoff, we stay in Queens (about 20 minutes away).  Need something? We're always a phone call or text away", "name": "Duplex sized for sharing", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b495f4cb-fb6a-469a-b1f9-41888543544d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16810467", "id": "16810467", "price": 104, "review": "Sam's apartment was the perfect size for what we needed it for which was just a place to keep our stuff, sleep and shower. With this being my second time visiting NY, I wanted to stay closer to the city but still in Brooklyn. It is very close to the M train and it never took us longer than 25 - 30 min to get into the city. Since it is so close to the train, it does get a bit loud but it didn't bother us at all. If you're a light sleeper, this is not the place for you. Since we made our reservation, Sam was very easy to contact and was quick to respond. Overall, our stay was great and I would recommend this to anyone with a group of people traveling together."}
