{"description": "Hi, there. My place is a lovely studio that is very conveniently located one block from the Q train. You will find the studio is very cozy and comfortable. It's perfect for those who want  to explore New York City, but come back to a quiet and clean space.\n\nThe studio is cozy and stylish. It is very private and has everything you'll need within the space: small sitting area, cooking area and a full bath. The bathroom is small, but comfortable. It is on the fourth floor of a walk-up building. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nI will meet you at the apartment to give you the keys.\n\nWalking distance (5 to 25 minutes) to: \nCarl Schurz Park \nCentral Park\nFrick Collection\nGuggenheim\nThe Met\n\nThe new 2nd Avenue train station is one avenue away with access to the Q train. You can transfer almost anywhere via the Q. The crosstown bus is personally my favorite and that's closer (first avenue and 86th street). And a little further away (3 long avenues) you have the 4/5/6 trains.", "name": "Studio (Cozy and Charming) in New York City UES", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/072a04d5-7acc-4a36-99c1-5d49789e36fd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17321072", "id": "17321072", "price": 150, "review": "Great spot, next to many great restaurants and things to do.
