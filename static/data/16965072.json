{"description": "A spacious ground floor condo with basement in the heart of Bedstuy. Our home is an open space decorated tastefully and for comfort first. It holds 2 bedrooms, a living area, kitchen and full bathroom on the main floor, and a large second living space with TV in the basement where you'll also find a second half bathroom and laundry room. Located within 10 minutes from 3 subway stations, and a couple of blocks from a large park. Restaurants, groceries, coffee shops all within a very short walk.\n\nLarge, open, lots of windows.\n\nThe only room that i would prefer to not grant access too is the kids room (unless you have a kid and would like to use it), otherwise, this door should remain closed.\n\nGreetings and goodbyes.\n\nWe have great neighbours and live in a very tight knit community. People will great you with a smile and hello wherever you go. \n\nYou'll find a grocery store just half a block away, pizza, Chinese food and a few other restaurants at equal distance as well. We are just near a large park, and in the summer, the public pool is just 2 blocks away.\n\nWe are a short 10 minutes walk from the J at Myrtle, as well as the G at Bedford Nostrand and Myrtle Willoughby trains stations. There are also several buses that run in the area taking you straight from in front of the house to the A-C trains and the Q, direct lines to Manhattan.\n\nThe Citi bike rental stand is also less then 1 block away.", "name": "Charming Large Home Away from Home", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0066195d-a845-4f65-8d64-a2de129075d3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16965072", "id": "16965072", "price": 159}
