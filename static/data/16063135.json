{"description": "Cozy and bohemian, my apartment is located close to midtown- Times Square, Herald Square, the UN, and is also very close to the East Village and downtown- Union Square, St. Marks Place, etc. It's truly a great location to explore NYC! This is a true, \"old school\" NYC apartment- high pressed tin ceilings with great natural light and the original prewar wood floor (!). The roof also has an unobstructed view of the Empire State Building. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.", "name": "Cozy bohemian apartment close to everything", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c0b7c1ea-8dd0-40f9-9b81-7fff25d6f3e2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16063135", "id": "16063135", "price": 150, "review": "Celine and her apartment were both fabulous!   We were within walking distance to everything we needed, and Celine made us feel so welcome once we arrived.  We've stayed at many AirBnBs and Celine was definitely the friendliest host we've had.  Stay here!"}
