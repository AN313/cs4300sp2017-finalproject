{"description": "Cosy little studio in the heart of chinatown. Five minute walk form the Lower East Side and Little Italy. It is close to all the best restaurants, and subway is on the doorstep.\n\nDespite being the heart of Lower Manhattan, the apartment is quiet and peaceful. Hardly any street noise can be heard. It is a fifth floor walk up.\n\nThe apartment is in Chinatown. This means the building and furnishings are neither modern nor renovated. Of course the apartment will be clean and comfortable, and it's in a perfect location for exploring the city \u2013 but it's definitely nothing fancy!\n\nMy husband and I are both PhD students, and this is our apartment. We are very comfortable here and love living in this area - we hope you enjoy it too!", "name": "Peaceful, cozy studio in Chinatown", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ac96399f-174f-4fbb-baed-7f2013429739.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16271281", "id": "16271281", "price": 90}
