{"description": "This apartment is in a fully renovated building on the Upper East Side. Minutes away from all of NYC's attractions such as museums, 5th avenue and central park! A few blocks away from both the Q and 6 trains.This is a great place for someone who wants to explore NYC. The kitchen and bathroom are fully functional.\n\nThe area is great with many bars and restaurants. You are also a few blocks away from the 2nd avenue and Lexington avenue subway line, central park, east river park and all the museums NYC has to offer.\n\nI do live a few blocks away so I will be available at all times.\n\nAll the restaurants and bars! I also love how accessible the rest of the city is to me because of the subways.\n\n2nd avenue subway line is less than a 7 minute walk and the Lexington avenue subway line is less than 5 minutes away", "name": "Modern place on the Upper East side", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dc5a0a9f-3c1a-46ee-b4b8-e21f4a09688a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16827389", "id": "16827389", "price": 159, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival.
