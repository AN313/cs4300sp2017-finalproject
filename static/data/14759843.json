He allowed us to do a late check out, meet us at the apartment, and offered his cell # to text him if we needed anything. The apartment was a clean functional studio, perfect for a couple crashing after a big New Year's night out. It was both quiet and got good light for a basement level apartment. Easy walk from the A train, and 3 blocks to Peaches Hot House for the best fried chicken! "}
