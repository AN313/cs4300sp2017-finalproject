You will not want to leave... this house and this block are a vortex of feel good.\n\nYou have access to the whole house, except the Mistress Bedroom. Closet space is not available. There barely is any to begin with;) back deck and living room and kitchen/dining space is shared\n\nAs often as they need\n\nI love the quietness, it's better to have a car here there is not much within walking distance. There is a corner store/bodega, and a laundry mat with an immediate walking distance. It's a 10 minute walk from the train, and a 15 minute walk to the grocery store, pizza shop, subway sandwich shop, and CVS.  The beach is right here!! As well as the boardwalk\n\nYes the A train is here at Beach 25th stop, it's about a 10-12 minute walk from the train to my house.   There is also the LIRR to Mott Street, which is an eight dollar Uber away\n\nIf you are interested in renting the whole house please contact me I can make this accessible for you.", "name": "Sweet and Sassy Bungalow by the Sea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/974a717e-63af-41a2-a459-e316a3711336.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16205526", "id": "16205526", "price": 95}
