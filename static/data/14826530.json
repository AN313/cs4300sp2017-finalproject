{"description": "My studio is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. There is a queen bed, desk, small kitchen, and bathroom. It's a cozy spot that I call home when you're not in town. Greenpoint is beloved for its youth culture, with hip bars, restaurants and shops. It's also close to Manhattan and accessible by bus, Citibike, subway, and river ferry. You'll be walking distance to Williamsburg and the East River waterfront, as well as McCarren and McGolrick Parks, and Long Island City.\n\nI am usually in town when I'm renting my apartment and available only in case of emergencies or lockouts.", "name": "Cozy Greenpoint Studio Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5d616052-97eb-4ea4-8659-9f648a206141.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14826530", "id": "14826530", "price": 100, "review": "Had a great stay.
