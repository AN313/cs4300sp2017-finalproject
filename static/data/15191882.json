The first day of our stay, there are two employees intrude our room without our consent, which makes us so scared and frightened. The manager of the hotel was not to solve the problem, and has repeatedly stressed that it is their right it makes us very shocked! BTW, no housekeeping is a little uncomfortable for a week stay."}
