{"description": "My place is close to The Wilky, Kalina Bar & Grill, McDonald's, Chez Alex Bakery, . You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the kitchen, the high ceilings, the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. The \"L\" Subway line is right around the current and is a direct route to 14th st./Union Square - NYC!", "name": "Luxurious 1 bed - 20 min to NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ab318a07-f3f3-432f-b31f-02dadbd9cb52.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14837854", "id": "14837854", "price": 140, "review": "Josh was very responsive and accommodating. We had one minor issue (no towels), but he fixed it willingly in a reasonable time period. The apartment is across the street from B60 bus and just around the corner from the L train at the Wilson station. Walking distance to several coffee shops, cafes, and markets. Interior is a bit nicer than I expected. Great little place!"}
