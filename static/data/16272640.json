First, the location is just perfect, close to everything! Manhattan is one stop away, and Williamsburg is such a beautiful neborhood. Great for bars, second hand shop and anything cool you can think about. The apartment it self was the cherry on top of the cake, it is absolutely beautiful and even ariel's pictures can't show enough how nice it actually is. You feel home instantly! I can't wait to come back.\nThank you Ariel for everything!"}
