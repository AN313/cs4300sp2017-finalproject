Prospect park, preferred by many over Central Park, is 1 block walk.", "name": "Friendly and well located place to get away", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/403a0b29-18ca-401e-85d9-ae9577f87184.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16914299", "id": "16914299", "price": 120, "review": "A comfortable tiny spot in the heart of Park Slope. It's essentially a hallway turned into an apartment. Tristan was friendly and helpful, but construction noise outside and uneven wifi made it uncomfortable for work. Fine for a night or two."}
