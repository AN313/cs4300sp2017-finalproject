{"description": "Very close to the L train Graham stop. Tons of cafe's, boutique clothing stores, bars and restaurants; Blue Stove, Variety, Mesa Coyoacan, Ringolevio, Lella Alimentari, etc. The neighborhood is amazing! Very old-school Italian area with proof of it on nearly every block. \nAPARTMENT: Fantastic natural lighting, open feeling, raw wood, books, pro kitchen goods & a welcoming feeling. Comfortable bed + couch/futon.  CLEAN place. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe large plants and beautiful raw wood all around give it that cozy \"tree-house\" feel that I mentioned. The cafe lights and lamps keep it intimate in the evenings and the bright natural light open it up during the day.\n\n*** Laundry mat right across the street that also offer \"fluff & fold\"  ***\n\nThe place is your's to enjoy. There is also garbage and recycling in the back yard.\n\nAn Italian neighborhood full of families that have been here for quite some time, and now welcoming all the young, fun professionals that have moved in over the past years. \n\nBlue Stove, Variety, Mesa Coyoacan, Ringolevio, Lella Alimentari, Anthony & Son Panini Shoppe\n\nThe bus runs right up and down Graham, there's CitiBike all over and the L-train Graham stop (3rd stop from Manhattan) is right down the street. The G-train Metropolitan stop is only a walk away as well, which heads north and south.", "name": "Bright, Cozy &  Quiet \"TreeFort\"-type ONE bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2b9d65a3-c5ce-4965-8e03-e8fa4427f526.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15772750", "id": "15772750", "price": 150, "review": "We absolutely loved our stay at Matthew's place. It was clean, tidy, very easy to get to, and in a prime location! It is the perfect place for two or three friends who are coming to the city and want to authentically experience New York, not just the touristy stuff! Would definitely stay there again!"}
