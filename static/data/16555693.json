{"description": "Our place is close to The M and L trains with direct access to Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Lower Manhattan. There is a playground across the street for kids too.. You\u2019ll love my place because we are in the heart of Ridgewood-- a quiet, safe neighborhood. We have a backyard and live across the street from a park. There are neighborhood bars, a grocery store one block away. Our neighbors are polite and quiet too. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Quiet, 2 bedroom / backyard", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0b392175-0fc0-4b47-a365-f288977d40ba.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16555693", "id": "16555693", "price": 115, "review": "The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.
