{"description": "My place is close to Highline park, Hudson River park, incrusted in the art gallery district and Hudson Yards. It's also a 4 minute walk to Macy's, Madison Square Garden, The McKittrick Hotel, Gallow Green, and Marquee New York. You\u2019ll love my place because of the views, the location, the ambiance, amazing restaurants nearby. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Chic Chelsea charming apartment, GREAT DECOR", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8e5f0679-c9a9-4367-9073-e6ea8e8d477a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16010302", "id": "16010302", "price": 275, "review": "Amazing place, lots of space, super close to Penn station!"}
