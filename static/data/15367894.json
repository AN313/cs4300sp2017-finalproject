{"description": "Our comfortable and spacious 2 bedroom has a truly Brooklyn feel. We can comfortably sleep 5 so great for a family or a group of friends. Minutes to two major subway lines that will have you into the city in less than 20 minutes!\n\nTwo bedrooms in a charming pre-war building. There is outdoor space that will be amazing in the summer months.\n\nThe entire apartment: living room, kitchen, 2 bedrooms, bathroom and outdoor space\n\nHopefully we will get to see you at either check in or check out. We are both busy / travel often so we may not get to meet in person.\n\nA short walk to the G train (5 minutes) and the C train (10 minutes). Citibike station nearby.", "name": "Spacious Bed Stuy 2 bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e949e501-8962-4b8a-8b7e-d019e94321ed.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15367894", "id": "15367894", "price": 140, "review": "A perfect space for a stay in Brooklyn. Easy to get into Manhattan and amazing taco shop next door. Only complaint is that it was very loud outside some of the nights. The hosts were very accommodating. "}
