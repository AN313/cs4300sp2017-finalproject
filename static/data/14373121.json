{"description": "This apartment is in the heart of Hell's Kitchen in midtown manhattan. It is a 10 minute walk to Time Square and a 10 minute train ride from most of manhattan. We are just a block or two from most of the subway lines. \n\nWe are looking for a couple or an individual to rent the apartment for the week.\n\nThis high ceiling sunlit high rise apartment is cozy and has great views of manhattan. The convenient location is great for any one just looking to live like a New Yorker for a week, or if you are here on business.\n\nHell's Kitchen has hundreds or bars and restaurants within a 5 minute walk. We are right on 50th between 9th ave and 8th ave which has amazing food and lots of great night life\n\nLiving in the heart of midtown, it couldn't be more convenient to get around with most of the subway lines just a few minutes walk, and multiple citibike locations as well.", "name": "Luxury Midtown High Rise", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6f24f68d-448c-4c5c-9b7a-e4eaabd5cc2e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14373121", "id": "14373121", "price": 175, "review": "Brandon was a great host. Although he was out of town for the duration of our stay he made sure the keys were readily available and left good instructions for navigating the flat. He also provided us with a laundry card, some meals and recipes on the fridge, and a token to use the city bikes. \n\nThe apartment was clean and self contained with nice furnishings, a big bed with comfy pillows, and fantastic views of the city. \n\nWe would definitely choose to stay here again given the opportunity. Thanks Brandon."}
