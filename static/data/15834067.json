{"description": "Our comfortable modern one bedroom apartment with great city views is a true haven. It comfortably fits two and is located on a lively street with cafes and shops. Just steps away from the subway and a short 10 minute ride from the city. A true gem!\n\nThe apartment was just updated with beautiful hardwood floors. We had the opportunity to re-design it with mid century modern furnishings and truly are loving it's refreshed vibe.\n\nOur guests will have exclusive access to the one bedroom apartment which is equipped with a full kitchen. There is easy park on the street as well.\n\nWe welcome guests and are happy to provide local recommendations and city tips. We are available should you need is but will give you complete privacy if you prefer.\n\nWe absolutely love our lovely neighborhood. There are restaurants of every cuisine within minutes, tons of great bars, convenient grocery stores and pharmacy. Really everything at your fingertips.\n\nThe apartment is just steps away from the R and M trains. It's also easily accessed by the N and G trains. It takes only 10 minutes to get into the city.", "name": "Charming 1BD Astoria Penthouse", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c290068c-9840-4414-9e5f-cd4226181d16.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15834067", "id": "15834067", "price": 110, "review": "Great Location, Great Service"}
