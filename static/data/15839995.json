{"description": "Cute 1br/studio in the heart of Williamsburg.  One building away from the entrance to the L train, but quiet because it's in the back of the building.  Bedford Ave. has all of the food, bars, and shopping you could need, and you're 1 subway stop from Manhattan.\n\nThe apartment has hardwood floors, an exposed brick wall, and pressed tin ceilings.  I am renting it out because I have moved.  Most of my belongings will be removed and there's plenty of room for storage.", "name": "Cute 1br/Studio in the heart of Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/37a0d2e0-74ab-42cc-a787-fb3900af2be7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15839995", "id": "15839995", "price": 150, "review": "Good place with all the essentials.
