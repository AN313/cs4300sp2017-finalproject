{"description": "My place is close to Uva, The Meatball Shop, The Frick Collection, J.G. Melon, and Maison Kayser. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the ambiance, and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers looking for a home base from which to explore the city. \n\nWalk-up building, check in time is flexible.\n\nI live in the apartment during the week, so clothes are hanging in the closets and drawers, but all sheets and towels are fresh and laundered for each guest and the apartment is cleaned. Guests can feel free to use the kitchen space or help themselves to any food or drink in the cabinets or refrigerator.\n\nThe 6 and Q trains are a short walk away and is the cheapest and often quickest way to get around the city.\n\nThere is free and metered parking on 1st ave and along the side streets in the area but you may need to be diligent/lucky in finding a spot depending on when you arrive.", "name": "Cozy, Convenient UES Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8b7ce1a7-483b-4f1e-a3c5-f5be15cfa17e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14725304", "id": "14725304", "price": 129, "review": "Everything was exactly as advertised.
