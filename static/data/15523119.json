{"description": "A comfortable three bedroom apartment in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Great neighborhood, 30 minutes from Manhattan. A quiet place to stay when you are in the city that never sleeps.\n\nPrivate and comfortable\n\nWasher/dryer, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, private balcony\n\nI am very active with my guests.
