We spend new year eve in time square which was the purpose of the trip. Kristin always replied as quick as possible to any needs of requests we had. She made sure we were ok the whole stay and even advised us on trains (tube), restaurant, bars...\nThe flat was exactly as it's described and found it even bigger than we thought. \nThe location is great, neighborhood was pleasant and polite. \nTransports very easy to access we got a train card for the week for $31 which we found very cheap and close to Manhattan. \nI would definitely recommend Kristin as a host as she kept contact with us to check of all was fine and she made herself available which we appreciated a lot.\nI would book again with her should I need to come back to NYC.
