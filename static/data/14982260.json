{"description": "The Astoria blvd stop on the N train is half a block away and a 17 minute train ride to Times Square. My place is close to Socrates Sculpture Park, Vesta Trattoria & Wine Bar, and Don Coqui (Latin dancing and great restaurant). You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the comfy bed, the kitchen, the atmosphere, and the outdoors space. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nAlso, half a block away from the Grand Central Parkway.\n\nGuests can have access to a parking spot for $20 extra per day if needed. Fits a standard sedan style car best. Please let me know the dimensions or car type beforehand.\n\nI have my brother that lives in the neighborhood, within a block radius. He will be available for questions.", "name": "Newly renovated 1-bm apt with a wooden deck.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a7f1b509-897e-4b9d-8011-b1f490026683.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14982260", "id": "14982260", "price": 180, "review": "Perfect place to stay during a trip in NYC.
