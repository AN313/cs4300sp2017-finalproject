For the price this place is okay, but it could use some TLC. Basically anything that could be broken is broken.  The listing says it sleeps four, but it is really only three (until the air mattress gets replaced). We had to buy our own towels. In the days before we arrived there were some moments of heartburn as Eduardo would not respond to my questions about check-in arrangements. Finally heard from him the day before we arrived, but at one point I was worried whether we really had a place to stay. The bathroom is REALLY small, but that is NYC forya!"}
