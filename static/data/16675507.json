{"description": "Very spacious 1 Bedroom Penthouse near Meeker and Kingsland in Greenpoint with a private roof deck that has a Manhattan skyline view.  Tons of natural light, large comfy couch, and a cozy bedroom.\n\n10 minute walk to Graham L train or Nassau G train. Ample street parking in front of building.\n\nBuilding has no elevator, apartment is a 5th floor walk-up but totally worth it for the view.", "name": "Penthouse w/ private Manhattan skyline view deck!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1a2d0077-a111-4b2f-a297-ace512ea4151.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16675507", "id": "16675507", "price": 125, "review": "This place is hip, and the view is breath taking!
