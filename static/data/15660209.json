Before checking in, I asked Anna if she has a mini fridge and she was kind enough to offer and get one for our stay. We got there the first day and while we were out, the fridge came and Anna set it up for us and it was ready to use. We really appreciated that because it helped us keep our food fresh. We loved how easy it was to communicate with our host, the privacy we had and ease of checking in. It was such a comfortable and enjoyable stay. "}
