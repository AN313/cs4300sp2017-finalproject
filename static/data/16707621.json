{"description": "Our apartment is the perfect place for guests who want to stay close to Manhattan but in a hip and quieter area. It is a clean and private one bedroom apartment. Has a full bathroom and fully equipped kitchen. 3 blocks from N train-15mins to city\n\nOur first floor apartment is decorated with local fine art and is kept very clean.\n\nGuests will have access to our pantry and fridge. Clean towels and sheets will be provided.\n\nWe will not be there. The place is all yours.\n\nOur neighborhood is thriving with great restaurants, markets, bars and parks. Many Greek and Japanese restaurants close by.\n\nManhattan is a fifteen minute ride-above ground- on the N train, which goes down the whole island on Broadway. The train station is three blocks from our place.\n\nWe have a cat in the apartment. His name is Ricky. He is very well behaved. The only thing we ask is that you feed him if his food is low and to change his litter if it becomes full.", "name": "NYC!
