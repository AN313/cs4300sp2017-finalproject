{"description": "This charming 2 BR apartment is in an historic Bed-Stuy townhouse, situated on a charming, tree-lined block. Steps from restaurants, cafes and grocery stores, the house is a 10-minute walk to the subway, where the A express and C local trains will get you to lower Manhattan in 15 minutes. \n\nRenovated, with wood flooring throughout and original details. NOTE: The galley kitchen has a stove top, but no oven. \n\nA lovely, blooming shared backyard has a picnic bench and grill, a perfect zen retreat!\n\nGreat landing pad to come home and wind down after exploring the city. You can relax in your private room, or lounge in the common room watching television, or even enjoy the lushly landscaped and woodsy backyard.\n\nGuests have access to everything in the apartment. For guests with small children, a travel crib and high chair are available on request. Backyard is furnished and shared with the apartment upstairs.\n\nI will not be available in person but I will always be available via phone, text, or email. A manager is available nearby for any on-site assistance needed.\n\nThere are coffee shops, wine shops and grocery stores on each corner. There are many restaurants and bars within a 5-10 minute walk away including Saraghina, L'Antagoniste, Manny's, Peaches, Chez Oskar, and Bar Lunatico.

Le m\u00e9tro est \u00e0 9min \u00e0 pieds et il y a pas mal d'endroits o\u00f9 manger autour (Comme le Manny's qui est tr\u00e8s bon).\nVous pouvez vous rendre \u00e0 Wall Street en 30min en m\u00e9tro. L'appartement est situ\u00e9 dans la partie en sous-sol de la maison. Les chambres sont tr\u00e8s grandes et confortable ainsi que la salle de bain. Mais le s\u00e9jour n'est pas tr\u00e8s grand. Ce n'est pas l'id\u00e9al si vous d\u00e9cidez d'y passer du temps, mais suffisant. C'est un peu bruyant. On entend les voisins du dessus. Mais nous y avons bien dormi et le rapport qualit\u00e9 prix est int\u00e9ressant.\nNikita a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 tous nos messages et nos demandes. Il y a un manager sur place en cas de soucis."}
