{"description": "My place is in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood - considered foodie heaven!  You\u2019ll love it's fantastic location. Great food and entertainment where ever you turn. Close to Central Park, Times Square, Columbus Circle, Chelsea Market,  and main subway/bus lines.  Lots of outdoors space good for cycling, walking and running. Beautiful sunsets and path along  the Hudson River.  Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nIt's a 4th floor authentic Manhattan walkup!\n\nEverywhere!\n\nWe are available to help out and offer guidance at any point.", "name": "Great studio in safe location - Midtown Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5cd23e16-1365-46d2-ab8a-43126bf4d74c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15532499", "id": "15532499", "price": 120, "review": "This is a really great place. It is NYC and right on the avenue. The entry of the building is a bit worn, but RIma and Chads studio is very comfortable and quiet.  The bed is like a dream.  And they both went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed.. and even left me a complimentary bottle of wine. The apartment does not get much light from the outside. So it was great for sleeping in. I love that there was no TV.   I could really relax and recharge for the next day.  I would definitely stay there again."}
