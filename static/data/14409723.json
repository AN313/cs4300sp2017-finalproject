{"description": "My place is close to Central Park, Bloomingdales, The Plaza Hotel, Serendipity 3, The Museum of Modern Art, and The Empire State Building. You\u2019ll love my place because of the views, the ambiance, and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Conveniently located in midtown on the east side of Manhattan with easy access to buses or the N, Q, R, 4, 5, and 6 train\n\nSunny and bright space with amazing floor to ceiling views of Manhattan.\n\nThis is a 24 hour doorman building, so it's very safe. There is a gym on the 3rd floor of the building, and a beautiful landscaped roof deck on the 11th floor.\n\nMy apartment is available when I'm out of town, so I will be there to greet you only.\n\nIt is close to the east river and Central Park...and allows easy access to all of the best shopping on Madison Avenue.\n\nThe building is very conveniently located to public transit. The closest subway station is 59th and 3rd Ave where you will have access to the N, R, and 6 train.", "name": "Charming & Spacious Studio in NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d424844d-5dd9-4468-a777-6542de88caa1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14409723", "id": "14409723", "price": 130, "review": "Kerry's place was excellent for my weekend trip to NY --  very clean, spacious, and just a few minutes' walk from the subway. The bed was very comfortable too. The apartment building was very nice, with a gym, doorman, and front desk staffed 24 hours for convenient check-in at any time. Staying at Kerry's apartment was an excellent experience and I would highly recommend it."}
