{"description": "Spacious, recently refurbished apartment in a gorgeous brownstone close to Fort Greene Park, Atlantic Terminal, the Barclays Center and the Pratt Institute - as well as tons of great bars and restaurants.\n\nIt's got a huge bedroom with lots of natural light, and the sofa converts to a very comfortable queen size bed. Full kitchen and bathroom, plus access to the roof for beautiful views. It's the perfect base to explore Brooklyn. \n\nGreat for couples, solo explorers, and business travelers.", "name": "Spacious 1BR in gorgeous Fort Greene brownstone", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0047443e-7dfc-43a5-82e8-e4b48ec6f365.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15021662", "id": "15021662", "price": 125, "review": "Lovely apartment in a great location near some very cool bars and eateries.
