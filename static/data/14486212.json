{"description": "My place is close to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Washington Heights, The Cloisters, George Washington Bridge, a short train ride to Columbus Circle and downtown. In addition to the master bedroom, the couch converts to a full size platform bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, small families and business travelers. Perfect NYC spot to stay home or to venture out. Grocery stores and a wine shop are a few blocks away.\n\nWe crafted our space to be neutral, relaxing and comfortable & quiet.\n\nGuests have access to the entire apartment. Closets are not available to guests.\n\nHost is available by phone, text and email.\n\nMostly hispanic families occupy the neighborhood as well as young professionals, Columbia medical school students & artists/musicians. Newest hippest area to be in NYC. If you walk on Fort Washington to 181 street, you will find great restaurants, bars and grocery stores.\n\nApartment is located 3 blocks from the A express train, C and 1 local train.", "name": "Spacious & cute apartment in Washington Heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3cd6163e-da18-4fa7-997d-d0b4497c4821.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14486212", "id": "14486212", "price": 125, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival.
