{"description": "My place is a converted one bedroom apartment five minutes away from Central Park and The Guggenheim and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Two flights up in an intimate, quiet building. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location and the coziness. You are one block away from the express 4,5,6 trains on 86th street. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nI will be in the area if you have any questions during your stay.", "name": "One bedroom apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6fe3eea9-53d5-4cae-92d4-0e11519b7fad.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15954511", "id": "15954511", "price": 148, "review": "Great location.
