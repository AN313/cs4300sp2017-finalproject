{"description": "My place is close to public transport and in New York this is very important.  It puts you in close proximity to everything including the beach, nightlife, family-friendly activities, and the airport. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness and the location, it is located in the lower level of our Victorian style home. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with older kids).", "name": "Cozy 1 bdrm in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e9360233-f97d-4e2d-b2cc-895e84d1f341.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15052480", "id": "15052480", "price": 129, "review": "Kavita's place is a clean, comfortable, well-cared-for apartment deep in non-hipster Brooklyn. Hosts couldn't have been nicer and the place was just right for us and our two little ones!"}
