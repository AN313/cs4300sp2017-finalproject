{"description": "Great apartment in the middle of everything! Charming, airy and walking distance to SoHo, West Village and Lower East Side. Near subway lines to get you anywhere in the city (B,D,F,M,N,R,Q,6). My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe location is amazing - so close to the best parts of downtown New York City!\n\nAccess to the kitchen and pots, pans, etc for cooking. TV available with cable, Netflix, and HBO.\n\nNot too often - we are often out of town or at work and keep to ourselves for the most part when we are in the apartment.\n\nBest restaurants, interesting people and CONVENIENCE!\n\nMany subway lines close to get you anywhere in Manhattan or Brooklyn quickly.", "name": "Great apt in amazing East Village!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/630a3139-bf47-4a10-b201-37295d1492ae.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15930495", "id": "15930495", "price": 119, "review": "We loved our stay in the city!
