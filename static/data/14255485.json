{"description": "My place is close to Yankee Stadium, Highbridge Park, The Cloister Museum, Fort Tryon Park, Jeffrey's Hook lighthouse  George Washington Bridge,  Bennett Park,  Bronx Community College, Fordham University  . You\u2019ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the light, and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nIt is a delightful pad with a warm elegant touch located in one of the most historic neighborhoods in NYC (at the border of Manhattan and the Bronx). I live just two streets away from the famous \"High Bridge\", which is New York City's oldest Bridge connecting the Bronx to Manhattan. It is the absolute perfect bridge for jogging and bike riding. I am also a 20 minute cab ride from the Bronx Zoo, the Cloisters Museum, and the Jumel Mansion, the oldest house in Manhattan. I live just ten minutes away (walking distance) from Yankee Stadium, home to the legenday Yankees Baseball Team. If you are looking for convenience and comfort, my place is definitely the best option.\n\n8 min walk to the 4 train \n2 min walk to the nearest bus stop", "name": "Entire One Bedroom Apartment In Historic District", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ec1dde7a-c746-4ecd-8514-2ebdcbcce053.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14255485", "id": "14255485", "price": 61, "review": "Really enjoyed my stay!
