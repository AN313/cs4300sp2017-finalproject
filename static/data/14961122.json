{"description": "Our ground floor studio in Bed Stuy is newly renovated and perfect for solo travellers, couples and families. It is just five minutes away from  the Halsey J and 10 minutes from the Ralph Ave C subway stations, about a 30/40 minute ride to Manhattan. Guests are free to use the laundry and dryer, dishwasher and bath, as well as the backyard. The neighbourhood is residential so even though the apartment is on the ground floor, noise is never a problem.\n\nWhen we aren't around our neighbour Elise will be available to help with anything or answer any questions you might have.\n\nAnimals are welcome but please advise us beforehand. Smoking is allowed only in the backyard.", "name": "Spacious studio with private garden in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/92561a9d-70bf-4039-b71f-5a6c01b966c8.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14961122", "id": "14961122", "price": 95, "review": "Gorgeous apartment!
