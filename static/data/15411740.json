{"description": "1 bedroom apt in the lower east side. 4 min walk to the subway (F, M, J, Z). 2 min walk to the Williamsburg bridge. Seconds away from restaurants, bars, and shops.\n\nCozy, Comfortable, and Clean.\n\nMost likely I'll be around the neighborhood. Depending on date and check in time I will meet you :)\n\nI'll be a call away if guests need anything.\n\nIn the heart of the lower east side. Next to all the bars and restaurant so if you plan on going out at night for dinner or drinks, it's a very convenient locations! It's also just 3 blocks away from the east village & 2 minutes from the Williamsburg bridge so you can cross over to Brooklyn in less than 10 minutes!\n\n3 amazing cafes of breakfast down the street (I recommend Pauls cafe and the spot on Clinton and Rivington for a quick breakfast & Clinton bakery for a big breakfast)\n\nTrain station is 4 minutes away (f, m, j, z)\n\nDelaney and Houston are 3 blocks away so very easy to get a cab as well.\n\n1 foam mattress bed and 1 sofa bed", "name": "LES 1 Bedroom Cozy Apt,", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/137f46c0-6c7e-4f5e-bf0e-62b0ea3561e4.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15411740", "id": "15411740", "price": 175, "review": "Everything was a breeze checking in and out of Andrea's place, she provided excellent recommendations and her place is super cute and comfortable!  Just be advised that it's on the 5th floor and there is no elevator.  Otherwise, loved it and would definitely stay again!"}
