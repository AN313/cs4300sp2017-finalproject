Very Convenient, 2 small blocks from N and R train 35 min to NYC. long strip of restaurants and Bars, large shopping area, all walking distance.\n\nmy place is a beautiful modern brand new renovated apartment. it is very private, separate entrance from any one else in the building. There will be a bed, a futon, a desk, dining table in the apartment. it is in a great area and safe neighborhood. There are many things to do all walking distance. In one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n\nyou will have access to the whole apartment. no one lives there. we use the place for airbnb renters only.\n\nWe live 7 min away from the property where the guest stay, so we will be available to help our guest any way we can.\n\nBay Ridge is one of the most expensive neighborhoods to live in.

Spacious, comfortable bed, small patio to enjoy a bit of air, large soft towels. Great neighborhood - clean, felt safe, people were friendly and lots of restaurants and shops and easy walk to the park and waterfront. Parking is very tight so we REALLY appreciated Safa's parking space in the back. Safa is pleasant and always responded immediately to questions.   "}
