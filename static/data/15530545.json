I stayed at a different airbnb before staying here and that one was in Williamsburg in a super expensive modern building and my stay at that one was subpar. So naturally, I had low expectations. When I arrived they were even lower but once I got up to the unit I was extremely relieved! It's super cozy and thoughtfully laid out. It was VERY clean which I LOVED. And Jaime has been a gracious host! Five stars!! Please try it out, you will not want to leave.  "}
