We fell in love with what we saw in the photos, nut the actual place is even better! Our hosts were very reachable, thoughtful and flexible whenever we had questions or requests before and throughout the stay. We stayed here during our apartment renovation that could have been stressful, but coming this warm home away home everyday knowing that there is nothing to be worried but everything what we need was such a great feeling. The community is a small and quiet, and people are so friendly. Because the apartment has an amazing kitchen, and Fairway supermarket in short 5 blocks, we enjoyed eating at home looking at the snowed garden, and missed the most of good looking restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. We may consider to go back for a weekend getaway. It would be wonderful to escape from the chaos of the city and a short subway ride can take us to this \"resort\"! Thank you Terumi and Brent!!"}
