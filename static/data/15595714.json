Only 2 blocks to the L train and 20 minutes to Manhattan. \nYou\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, Edwardian building details, proximity to dozens of hip bars and restaurants, large kitchen and the quick access to the L train. \n\nI'm work in hospitality industry; my expertise definitely reflects in the care I take to make my guests feel welcome.\n\nOnly a couple blocks from the L and a 15 minute walk from the JMZ.", "name": "Sumptuous & Lovely Williamsburg 1 Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ed5d49fd-0056-4033-9fe3-22fa32cb71fd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15595714", "id": "15595714", "price": 110, "review": "We had a very pleasant stay in Catherine's apartment. She is a great host and was very responsive, promptly responding to our requests. She left everything we needed for use - tea, coffee and even a bottle of wine. She also left some cooking ware, what was very convenient given that we were staying with a kid.\r\nThe neighborhood was also very convenient - 5 min walk to L line and there were few grocery shops at walking distance. The building itself is quite old and you can hear how the neighbors leave and come in, but overall they were quite and were switching music and TV at night. \r\nThe apartment was nice and even more spacious than I expected. The furniture and arrangement was exactly as on photos.\r\nIn general I would highly recommend this host and apartment to anyone who is looking for a convenient location and family-friendly environment. \r\n  "}
