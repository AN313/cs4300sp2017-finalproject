Definitely true NY living. I would definitely stay again. The people in the next building were a little loud but that's apartment living for you at its best. MacDonough Cafe has a great light breakfast and a great view for people watching. The exterior needs a little maintenance but nothing to discourage you. It is an original brownstone so of course things are a little older. The place was clean and I felt very secure with my stay. Quick response time from the Management Company and Host. I definitely enjoyed my short stay."}
