In the winter the property is heated, and for summer we have an air conditioner in the living room and bedroom - leaving both on will keep the place nice and cool.  We only rent while we are away - but our incredibly friendly cat will be home during your stay - the place is best for cat lovers only.  You need not worry about cleaning up after him - we have someone come in to do that - but he is very friendly and loves company - so whatever companionship you wish to share with him is welcome!\n\nThe whole apartment is yours - enjoy!\n\nWhile we travel quite a bit for work, we will always be available by phone, email or SMS should issues arise if we are not around during your stay.  Also, we LOVE our home - New York City!!

The neighborhood itself has some great local restaurants - most that deliver.  We also have a Starbucks.  For those who wish to eat at home there is a supermarket or you can get your food delivered from Fresh Direct!\n\nIn addition to public transportation, Uber and Lyft are readily available in our neighborhood.\n\nAs noted - you will share the home with our cat - he will be there for all visits through early April.", "name": "One bedroom apt close to Manhattan CAT LOVERS ONLY", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/306c89d7-3252-4b65-9c7c-cc125c31a655.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16032721", "id": "16032721", "price": 66, "review": "Everything was cool"}
