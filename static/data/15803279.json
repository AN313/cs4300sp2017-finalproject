{"description": "The apartment is extra large and can comfortably accommodate groups. It is also perfect for a couple to enjoy a luxurious and affordable stay in NYC. The subway is 5 minutes walking distance from the apartment and  reaches Manhattan in 15 minutes. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood. The apartment comes with a private balcony overlooking Brooklyn.\n\nThe space is decorated tastefully with heaps of green plants. The apartment is fully stocked with fresh towels, linens, toiletries, and cookware.\n\nThe entire apartment is all yours!\n\nI am nearby in the neighborhood and available by phone or Airbnb messenger if you need anything.\n\nThe neighborhood is mostly Caribbean and rapidly gentrifying. Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and the Brooklyn museum are all within a 10 minutes walk.\n\nThe B and Q trains are nearby at the Prospect Park subway station. The Q train runs express and reaches Manhattan in 15 minutes.", "name": "Restful", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fea11f92-58f1-458e-8f54-15cf5c2ac90c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15803279", "id": "15803279", "price": 120, "review": "Satvic's place appeared as it was pictured and is very spacious. The location is conveniently located next to the subway.  However, clear and concise communication was strained as I waited for 45 minutes trying to reach him for check-in. Initial responses were vague. "}
