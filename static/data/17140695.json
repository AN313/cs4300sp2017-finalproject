{"description": "Designer apartment in an elevator/doorman building in Bushwick, which has a communal movie room, piano and gym. Apartment has a full kitchen, tons of cooking gadgets, and high-speed wifi. Bathroom has a soaking tub with rain shower head. The rooftop offers fantastic views of Manhattan, rocking chairs to chill out in and a dog park. The neighborhood is quintessentially Brooklyn, and known for its colorful street art. Good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families. Small pets OK.\n\nThe apartment faces the building's inner courtyard, so it's really quiet at night (perfect for light sleepers).\n\nBushwick is a creative/hipster neighborhood without all the pretentiousness of Williamsburg. There are awesome coffee shops, restaurants, bars, street art and parks within walking distance.\n\nConveniently located between the L and J/M train lines.\n\nThere is ramp access to the elevator for wheelchairs or baby strollers.", "name": "Sun-Filled Apartment in Creative Bushwick", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/83a1edf8-8f83-434b-9831-e4903fc298fe.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17140695", "id": "17140695", "price": 75}
