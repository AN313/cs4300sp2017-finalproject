The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and residential, but also filled with restaurants and coffee shops and any other amenities you might need. Guy gave us great recommendations and was always available to answer questions. The apartment is just minutes from the 7 train. Inside, we enjoyed a brand new kitchen, curated furniture, and a particularly comfortable bed. The walls are adorned with large prints of Guy's own photographs taken on world travels. We loved staying here and would return anytime. "}
