{"description": "My place is close to Tenement Museum, Essex Street Market, Russ & Daughters Cafe, The Bowery, NOLITA, SOHO, LES, Nightlife. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the coziness, the high ceilings, the kitchen, the exposed brick, the space. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nYou will have all the space to hang clothing in the large armor in the bedroom along with the hooks on the bedroom door and the shelf space.", "name": "LES Charming One Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/60257db5-8a01-4cc9-bf92-043e1d3c8783.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16615461", "id": "16615461", "price": 115, "review": "We had a great stay in the city at Audrey's place.
