While this particular location in Brooklyn isn't ideal for those looking to explore the more \"happening\" parts of the borough, it was conveniently located to the event we were attending and fairly priced. Overall a great stay. Lita was a lovely host providing everything we needed in the rental as well as helpful information to navigate the neighborhood. "}
