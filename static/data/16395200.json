It is so conveniently located in Manhattan, so that we could explore the city easily. All is just like the photos and descriptions suggest -- very clean and comfortable, with big windows. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment is very safe and quiet, with a supermarket on the corner. J did an excellent job of communicating with us, organizing check-in and check-out.  Thanks J for making us feel like home! I definitely recommend J's place."}
