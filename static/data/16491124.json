The neighborhood offers incredibly authentic and affordable international food, all within walking distance from the apartment. This is a safe, family oriented, immigrant neighborhood that is authentically New York.\n\nYou will have access to the whole apt.\n\nThis is a short cab ride away from LaGuardia Airport. Jazz fans will appreciate Louis Armstrong House Museum here in Elmhurst. This also makes a great base from which to head to Citi Field for a Mets game/series.\n\nClose proximity to numerous buses, as well as M, R and 7 trains. E and F trains are also nearby. Short train ride into midtown Manhattan.\n\nWashers and dryers available in basement of building. These machines are not coin-operated.
