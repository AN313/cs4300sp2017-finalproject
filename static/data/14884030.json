You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, The area is Full of restaurants & $8 yoga a 10 minute walk away. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.\n\nThere is a court yard & car space if required!\n\nAstoria is full\nOf wonderful & enticing restaurants .. I feel like AStoria is the old Manhattan \n\nI will reply as soon as I get notified! I will meet & greet you anytime you wish to come!! P.s I am so new to this, this is the first I have listed my space. Someone booked, without me interacting with them, and I did not approve. The person sent money & everything. I had to cancel cause I didn't feel safe! Now I have apparently a mark next to my name that I cancelled! So please be kind & understand I am new, and still trying to navigate X\n\nYoga Agora is the best! All teachers are on point & classes are $8\n\n15mins 3 subway stops to 5th Ave Central Park Manhattan! 25mins to the flatiron building the N & Q Trains are the best in Manhattan ..
