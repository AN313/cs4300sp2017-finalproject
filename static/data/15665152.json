The house was built in 1895 and is full of historic charm. \n\nThere are plenty of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, bakeries and bars nearby.

We live upstairs and also use the yard from time to time, but it'll be mostly yours during your stay.\n\nWe have a small dog who lives in the upstairs apartment with us.  She's quiet and friendly.  She uses the yard sometimes but otherwise you will not have to interact with her unless you would like to.  She loves meeting new people!", "name": "Charming 2-Bedroom Brownstone Garden Level Apt.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9141bba1-e12f-454e-8255-69413be1606e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15665152", "id": "15665152", "price": 120, "review": "Eric est un h\u00f4te aussi parfait que son logement !!!\nIl est \u00e0 la fois discret et disponible \u00e0 tout moment, et quel plaisir d'\u00eatre accueilli par un mot gentil et une bouteille de vin en arrivant.\nL'appartement est comme sur les photos...en mieux :)\nIl est spacieux, extr\u00eamement propre, tr\u00e8s calme, bien \u00e9quip\u00e9 en tout, les lits sont confortables, et l'acc\u00e8s au jardin/cour priv\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able lorsqu'il fait bon, pour y faire une pause.\n\nLa rue est extr\u00eamement agr\u00e9able et calme (nous avons ador\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents quartiers de Brooklyn) mais je signale tout de m\u00eame que les environs ne sont pas aussi r\u00e9sidentiels que la rue elle-m\u00eame.\n\nBreakfast et/ou lunch chez Manny's, d\u00eener chez Oskar ou chez Saraghina (pizza exceptionnelles !!!), sont les 3 adresses conseill\u00e9es par Eric que nous avons ador\u00e9 !\n\nL'acc\u00e8s aux 3 diff\u00e9rents lignes de M\u00e9tro est \u00e0 5 \u00e0 10 minutes de marche maximum, et Manhattan est \u00e0 30 \u00e0 45 minutes de transport (en fonction de l'endroit o\u00f9 l'on souhaite aller).\n\nBref, nous avons ador\u00e9 notre s\u00e9jour et recommandons vivement cet appartement \u00e0 ceux qui voudraient d\u00e9couvrir New York un peu diff\u00e9remment."}
