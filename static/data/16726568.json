{"description": "My place is close to Close to 6, NQR, BDFM subway lines, countless bars, restaurants & coffee shops. You\u2019ll love my place because it's on a quiet block in a lively neighborhood, facing a back yard. Impossibly quiet for NYC and very safe. Neighbors are all lovely, everything is clean and hallways are newly renovated. I have a giant comfy bed that's good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.
