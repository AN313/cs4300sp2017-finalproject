{"description": "2-bedroom apartment in the heart of the LES. Tons of bars and restaurants nearby, and a 5-minute walk to the FM and JZ trains. Very quiet apartment (no street noise at all!). There's a wine fridge to chill all your wine, and a washer dryer if you're staying a while. \n\nThere are 2 private bedrooms with full-size beds, and a full-size futon in the living room.", "name": "Entire 2BR LES Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c1d426bf-9a6f-4b0b-b0c6-43f1a90e3317.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16441725", "id": "16441725", "price": 350, "review": "Great Stay"}
