Bedstuy is, hands down, the best neighborhood in NYC and her apartment is centrally-located within it - close to bars, coffee shops and shopping. The train is about a 12-15 minute walk, but since the neighborhood is so beautiful, it's an enjoyable walk. \n\nHer place was very clean and quite larger than I expected. Be sure to check out the rooftop patio (no matter how cold it is outside) - great views!\n\nMara was also wonderful at communicating with us, and was a joy to work with. This is the type of place you will use over and over again for your trips to NYC. "}
