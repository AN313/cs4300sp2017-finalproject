The flat was clean, and enough large for two persons or more (max 4). I was with my daughter who slept in the large bed in the bedroom and me in the living on a confortable air matress. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom small but usefull. There is a large sofa, a tv and wifi. Clean towels and sheets were available. The flat is at the 5th floor (no elevator) in a safe area and very close from the train station line 4 from 30 mn to middle Manhatan town. There are many shops around. Daniel was very friendly and available. We had a very good stay in New York !"}
