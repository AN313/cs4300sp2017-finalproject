{"description": "My place is only few blocks to Central Park. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood: Few blocks from the new subway at 2nd Ave, Lots of great restaurants and bars, cinema, coffee places. \nMy place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\nMy building has elevator, door man, laundry, wireless internet, computer, printer, cable tv, air conditioner/heater, an amazing comfortable memory foam queen size bed and a great and strong shower.", "name": "Super comfortable place to rent!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c1032f16-847c-46e9-8646-7573e579cb3f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15282640", "id": "15282640", "price": 185, "review": "Myself and my partner visited New York for a long weekend. We initially booked and confirmed with a different apartment which was cancelled by the host, which we are actually grateful for as we then found Cristiane's place.\n\nThe area is lively enough but you can't gear anything from the bed. The connections to transport are great; the bus stops outside the door and the subway is just 5 blocks away. However the distance to Central Park was the best thing; imagine being so close that you can walk through it every day to get to the city. \n\nI had previously mentioned to Cristiane that the reason for our visit was my 30th birthday and it was made all the more special when we got to the room to see Cristiane had not only left us a number of \"things to do in NYC\" guides that she had written, but also a bottle of 6100 Vodka which went down a treat (hands down the nicest vodka we've ever drank).\n\nThe apartment was clean and tidy, the shower was awesome and the bed felt like we were sleeping on a cloud. I'd not only recommend staying at Cristiane's, I'll be making sure we do next time we are in NYC. "}
