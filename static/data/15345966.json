Kitchen, living room, private entrance, and always able to find parking. Would definitely stay again. Stores close by such as Target, TJ Maxx, Modells, and for eating, plenty as well. Bus passes right in front even tho bus stop is down the block. Convenient for anyone who's going to use public transportation."}
