{"description": "Sunny large 1 bedroom apartment in historical block in Clinton Hill. Top floor of a corner brownstone.  The apartment has a vintage feel and warm vibes. The decor is simple but quaint. It reflects my love for colors and items collected from my travel.\n\nSpace to relax in the living room and bedroom. Perfect for a couple or solo traveler. The extra bed in the bedroom can be used for a child or additional person. The kitchen is equipped with the necessary to cook.\n\nClinton Hill is vibrant and chill neighborhood at the same time. Lot to do and discover. Coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, Fort Greene park and more within walking distance.\n\nEasy access to the city, located a block away from the subway and bus stop. The G train is a block away. Bus 38 will get you to the B/Q/N/R to the Dekalb station and 2/3/4/5 to the Nevins station.", "name": "Cozy 1 bedroom in Clinton Hill", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c78a19e8-e2cb-4ee7-bcbc-2ae0111004da.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16258672", "id": "16258672", "price": 135, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival.
