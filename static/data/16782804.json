Lot of reasonably priced restaurant nearby. Metro is a 10 min walk away. Very nice Belgian Waffle House with very good coffee around the corner (breakfast tip)! \nRasheed is a good host, willing to help and responds to messages quickly! \nRoom was very tidy when we arrived. I recommend sleeping with ear plugs if you're not used to the noise, it is NYC and the city really never sleeps..! "}
