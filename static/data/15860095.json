{"description": "Our cool and comfortable two bedroom apartment has a real Brooklyn feeling. We live in a gaming house and have an Xbox one, ps4, wii, gamecube and n64. We are located in the heart of Crown Heights. What's truly amazing about this spot is that we are 4/20 friendly and I can accommodate up to four people plus the trains are a few blocks away.  The Brooklyn Museum, Jewish Museum, Botanical Gardens and many more attractions are near by.\n\nI am renting out the whole 2 bedroom apartment so there is access to the living room and kitchen as well.  Both rooms have air conditioners and heaters.  Please make sure you turn them off when not in use.  Apartment is located in a five story building on a very nice and safe block.  The 3/4 trains and bus lines are two blocks away.  \r\n\r\nGreat place to stay for out-of-towners.  \r\n\r\nPlease contact me if interested.\n\nBedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and living room\n\nI will not be home but will leave information for The person regarding trains and buses.
