{"description": "Your private apartment is a 10-min. walk to the famous Staten Island Ferry (free) to lower Manhattan and subway connections. Many restaurants and pubs are in our historic neighborhood of St. George. It's a short drive or bus to Snug Harbor Cultural Center. We have a friendly dog, but he will not be in your private space. A dbl air mattress can be provided for children and a playground is nearby. Parking is available in our driveway; if you need a ride from the ferry we are happy to pick you up.\n\nJust outside your entrance is a private porch (see the photos), a small George Forman electric grill, and a large fenced-in backyard with a hammock for the warmer weather.\n\nWe will be in the main part of the house and on-site for any issues or questions. We are happy to offer any suggestions or advice. While we will respect your privacy, we also know NYC and enjoy showing people around if that's what you would like.\n\n\"It is by logic we prove, but by intuition we discover.\"  (Leonardo da Vinci)", "name": "Lovely, private studio apartment near Manhattan.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f794985c-9476-4249-bd0c-69ddf837d271.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17075535", "id": "17075535", "price": 110, "review": "John was very hepful the entire trip. He walked us to the ferry and explained in detail how to use the subway (which we had never done). Thanks to his directions and the $10 metro card he provided, we navigated the subway! He also had beer in the fridge to welcome us and got out toys just for my daughter. We would glady stay here again and I would recommend this place to others. You are about a 45 min commute to Times Square but the ferry is free and simple. John will help with any questions. "}
