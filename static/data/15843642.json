{"description": "My place is close to family-friendly activities, nightlife, public transportation. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the newly renovated kitchen, modern bathroom.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nGuests have access to almost everything in the apartment. I live upstairs but I will not be invading your personal space. I want you to feel as comfortable as possible so make yourself at home. There is a full living room with reclining couches, a huge flat screen TV, wifi, washer & dryer, & a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. I try my best to always have everything you need during your stay so don't hesitate to ask!", "name": "Renovated Downstairs Apartment in a Private House", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ae167c2e-9b4d-4f29-84e7-0d56d5f4c5d5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15843642", "id": "15843642", "price": 85, "review": "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
