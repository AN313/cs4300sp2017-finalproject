They made it easy for us to check in and check out of their home. The 103rd station is a couple minutes away which makes it very easy to get downtown quickly. It takes about 20-25 minutes to get to Midtown/East village. Also, central park is abou a 5-10min walk and 5th avenue buses run all the way down towb. We always had contaxt with them and if he had any concerns they were a call away. Loved our stay and hope to stay here again in the future."}
