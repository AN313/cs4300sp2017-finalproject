{"description": "My place is 3 blocks from the 7 train, a 10 minute ride to Manhattan and close to Brooklyn. You\u2019ll love my place because Sunnyside is full of restaurants, bars, cafes, diners, and there's a cheap grocery next door that closes at midnight. My place is quiet, good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). There is only one small bed, but the carpet is new and suitable for sleeping. ***new coffee maker!", "name": "Spacious 1 bdrm apt in amazing location", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/11922b81-cae0-4301-9612-28f6278e2d2a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16811199", "id": "16811199", "price": 120}
