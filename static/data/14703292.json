{"description": "My place is in hip and fun Park Slope. Try some of the best restaurants, take a stroll up the slope to Prospect Park, shop in boutique stores, and best of all - you are 30 seconds away from 9th street/4th avenue subway station (R & F lines).  You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance, the outdoors space, the neighborhood, the comfy bed, and the light. We have a beautiful yard which is great for people-watching. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nSpend time in a Park Slope, Brooklyn home that was built in 1899! This studio has all the basics you need for a great trip: wifi, working stove, dishes, table/chair, small couch, and lovely front yard to sit out and relax.\n\nYou'll have private access to your studio unit, of course, but you may also use the front yard to sit and people-watch, have some coffee, or read a good book.\n\nRoger will meet you to hand over keys at agreed-upon time.
