{"description": "The up-and-coming neighborhood of Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn is ideal! The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and Prospect Park are next door, and the neighborhood has great coffee shops and a variety of restaurants. \n\nThe apartment is quiet and offers a cozy and  affordable stay in NYC. It is ideal for couples, but can comfortably accommodate groups of three or four. The nearby B/Q subway is three minutes walking distance from the apartment and reaches Wall Street, Manhattan in 15 min.", "name": "Simple", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d003e829-2d5a-4ac7-a437-df58a0debe96.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14322269", "id": "14322269", "price": 130, "review": "The pictures are accurate of the apartment.  The apartment was clean, nice, and actually quite large by NYC standards.  Bed was very comfortable.  You also can't beat the location.  Right across the street form the park and also right across from the subway. "}
