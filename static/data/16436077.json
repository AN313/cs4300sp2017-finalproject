{"description": "Light, quiet, one bedroom apartment on the top floor of a traditional brownstone. One block from the train with additional options in a short walk to historic Fulton Street. Close to Speedy Romeo, Olea, BAM Harvey Theater, Bedford Hill Coffee Bar, Choice Market, Pratt Institute, Fort Greene Park, Urban Vintage. You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance, the neighborhood, the light, the comfy bed, the kitchen, the bathtub. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThere is not a dining table in the apartment, but there is a full kitchen and multi use side table.", "name": "Bright and quiet space in Clinton Hill", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9e9a1ab8-45e1-47e8-b903-170481d8acfc.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16436077", "id": "16436077", "price": 130, "review": "Simmone's place is lovely and bright, just as the descriptions says, with big windows on two sides of the flat. The neighbourhood is also great, with restaurants and bars only a couple of minutes away. Simmone's place is very well equipped, and Simmone herself was a lovely host, very helpful and easy to communicate with.  I would highly recommend Simmone's lovely bright space in Clinton Hill!"}
