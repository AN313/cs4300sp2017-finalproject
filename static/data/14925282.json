{"description": "Conveniently located next to the red line which you can take uptown or downtown and easily access top attractions and/or transfer to other lines easily.\nUnlike many listens in the city my little haven of an apartment is very quiet and serene. It is located in the back of the building which provides for its tranquility and serenity. \n.\n\nBeautiful one BR/studio in East Harlem (aka Spanish Harlem). Hardwood floors, full kitchen with a small sitting area, full bathroom with bathtub, and queen size bed.\n\nFull access to the apartment via the elevator or stairs. Located on the fourth floor.\n\nI may or may not meet you when you arrive to give you the keys depending on your arrival time.\n\nVery lively, fun and safe neighborhood. Spanish Harlem is a great thriving and growing neighborhood. Great little eateries, bars and long time establishments! Also close to the Upper East Side and a bus ride away or ten minute walk from other Harlem landmarks (Apollo theater, etc)...\n\nCheck out the following links for more information on popular and must see spots and eats in Harlem:\n\n(URL HIDDEN)\n\n(URL HIDDEN)\n\n(URL HIDDEN)\n\nSubway at 116th and Lexington is literally 30 second walk left as you exit the front door of the apartment building.
