My host, Alyssa, was great!  The brownstone was exactly like the description.  It was elegant, clean, comfortable and most importantly, convenient to my daughter's apartment a few blocks away.  The neighborhood was great and we found many great places to eat nearby.  I would definitely contact Alyssa again through airbnb when I am in town to visit my daughter, husband and new grandbaby.  I could not have had a better Christmas!"}
