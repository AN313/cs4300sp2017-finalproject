{"description": "Our spacious junior one bedroom in the heart of the East Village is the perfect place to stay for a downtown NYC experience. The closest subway is the crosstown L train that can take you East into the heart of Williamsburg or West towards the cobblestone streets of the West Village. You're a 10 minute walk away from Union Square where you can catch all major trains to any part of the city. We have everything to offer!\n\nBeing close to many great restaurants, bars and cafes. East 10th street is really special.\n\nYES!\n\nL Train is 4 blocks away\n4,5,6 & N,R, Q,W 15 minutes away\n\nSoHo, Chinatown, Lower East Side, and the Village are all walking distance.", "name": "Charming East Village jr 1 bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ac80258f-e1a5-41e2-bb11-0123ddb319b3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16735496", "id": "16735496", "price": 125, "review": "Mary's place was a super chill spot to crash for a couple nights. The record player was a great touch and it's in the middle of everything East Village/LES. Note that it is a lived-in apartment with all the classic grunge of NYC so if you are looking for a hotel experience this might not be the spot. However, it was definitely the perfect place for me. I had a blast and will definitely be coming back next time it's available!"}
