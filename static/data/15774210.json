{"description": "my apartment is a half block from prospect park & the grand army plaza farmers market, a short walk to 5th ave shops and restaurants, close to subways, near the brooklyn museum, the brooklyn botanical gardens, the brooklyn academy of music, the library, barclay center and a quick ride to manhattan!  the southern exposure brings great light into the living area all year round and the fireplace and new kitchen make cooking and relaxing a joy! great for couples.\n\nThe apartment is in a quiet building on a beautiful brownstone and tree lined block in historic Park Slope.\n\nYou'll have access to the whole apartment.  There is a great kitchen, a fireplace, a record player as well as full cable and wifi access.\n\nThe neighborhood is great for strolling, exploring and dinning with lots of coffee shops, cute shops and restaurants within a few blocks.  I am also close to museums, subways and other great neighborhoods such as Ft Greene, Gowanus, Sunset Park, Clinton Hill and Crown Hts.  DUMBO and the beautiful brooklyn waterfront is also near by.\n\nTaxis and Subways are all easy to access.  It's a bout a 20minute ride into Manhattan's Union Square, Chinatown or a 2 more train stops to Times Square and the Theater District or Central Park.", "name": "beautiful artistic 1 bdrm in Park Slope, Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/688a9ae2-9c21-49e6-9289-170b7e254089.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15774210", "id": "15774210", "price": 125, "review": "A beautiful and tasteful apartment on the fifth floor of a walk-up, situated on a quiet street near Prospect Park.
