It's a cozy studio with a huge balcony facing Broadway that provides a classical NYC streetscape.  The murphy bed is cozy -- but might be a bit narrow for a couple -- I was staying there by myself, so it wasn't an issue.  The kitchen is great and has all the essentials, including a nespresso machine and capsules, a very nice gas stove, and a dishwasher.  Wifi was fast and reliable.  The bathroom is spacious, with a nice shower head and great water pressure.  Alex was an incredibly gracious host, with superb communication and a smooth check-in and the apartment is clean.  The building has a 24/7 doorman, so it's super safe.  Can definitely recommend Alex's place to anyone without reservations and would definitely stay there again!"}
