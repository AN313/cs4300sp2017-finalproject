{"description": "This very clean one bedroom, with modern amenities, hardwood floors and AMAZING natural light, is on the 4th floor of a beautiful brownstone in South Harlem. A 6 minute walk in either direction to subway trains that have express lines which will get you ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE you want to go - in a short amount of time. Few minute walk to all the cool restaurants and bars on and near Lenox Ave in Harlem. Beautiful tree-lined streets.  Safe. Very quiet building and neighborhood.", "name": "1 Bedroom in a gorgeous brownstone in South Harlem", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4aa13a21-e6bf-46c3-911d-a023b81a56dc.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16794070", "id": "16794070", "price": 69, "review": "This was a GREAT space to stay over the weekend.
