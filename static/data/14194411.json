We spent a great time in NYC with my family. We would have appreciated that Franco had welcomed us with a smile and some advice. Thankfully his wife was nice and very helpful. Do not expect to have breakfast provided but some leftover from previous guest. The TV has a damaged sceeen and signal is not receptionned properly but we didn't come to NYC to watch TV... The kitchen lack some equipement to cook and cupboard to store food and there is no toaster. The flat is clean in overall. Only few things need to be done to make this appartement a great place to stay. "}
