To me, it was a nice place to rest our heads for the evening but upon walking into his apartment, the word \"nice\" was definitely an understatement.  Dan's apartment was an absolute DREAM.  Everything was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the shower...I could have lived in that shower, and the location couldn't be beat.  Dan was super responsive, friendly, and you could tell he takes a lot of pride in his apartment.  Cannot wait to plan another trip up there in the near future!  "}
