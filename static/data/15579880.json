{"description": "My place is close to Pratt Institute, Brooklyn Kolache Co., and Colador Cafe. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the ambiance, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets). It's a giant apartment in a great neighbourhood close to Manhattan, Williamsburg, Bushwick, Clinton Hill and within walking distance to some great restaurants and bars!", "name": "Cozy and Lovable Bedstuy Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16df2553-92b5-485b-bb0b-15f01cbd34db.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15579880", "id": "15579880", "price": 125, "review": "The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.
