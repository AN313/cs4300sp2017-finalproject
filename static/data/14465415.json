{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of the best location in New York- Forest Hills. 1 block from shopping centers. Five minutes walking distance to subway and 10 minute ride to Laguardia and Kennedy airports. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nThe house was renovated recently;  New kitchen,  new appliances  (refrigerator, stove). All furniture new (as of August 2016), new windows throughout the house.", "name": "Forest Hills", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a232d7c5-c26a-4330-b90f-ade708ef1a63.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14465415", "id": "14465415", "price": 135, "review": "The host was easily accessible by phone and very accommodating. It takes about an hour to get into Manhattan by subway from the location, and there are many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Overall, this space is a great value if you come with a group."}
