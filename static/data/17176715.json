{"description": "Walking distance from both Bedford Avenue and the Williamsburg Bridge, you will have access to many neighbor bars and food stops in South Williamsburg. Our exposed brick and new appliances make the apartment feel modern, without losing a sense of home and community. Feel free to play our eclectic records from Phil Collins to Taylor Swift. And don't hesitate to sing along, while enjoying the Brooklyn breeze in the shower.", "name": "South Williamsburg apartment, great location", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c57b5642-617a-4f42-87ff-155cf56a1681.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17176715", "id": "17176715", "price": 260, "review": "Just wow!
