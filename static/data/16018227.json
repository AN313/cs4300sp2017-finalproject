{"description": "This bright, street facing queen size one bedroom features 12-foot ceilings, a large living room with huge windows, beautiful refinished hardwood floors, and a spacious closet. The apartment also includes Phillips Hue lights that you can control with your phone to create beautiful lighting schemes. Nestled in the heart of the west 80s, the apartment is steps away from Central Park as well as great restaurants, entertainment, and shopping. Access to 3 major subway lines just 5 minutes away.\n\nThe high ceilings in this place makes it look and feel like a loft. My bed is the most comfortable bed you'll ever sleep on, money back guaranteed. I also have a top line queen size inflatable bed that can accommodate additional guests. My neighbors are super nice, and the UWS, well the UWS just speaks for itself. Minutes away from the 1, B, and C trains and the iconic Jacky Onassis Reservoir in Central Park.\n\nTv, PS4, kitchen and everything else in the apartment.\n\nAs often as they need me.\n\nThey are extremely nice and respectful.\n\nYes.\n\nEnjoy yourselves in this great city.", "name": "Beautiful High Ceilings Apartment by Central Park.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c5872f8a-5a71-4bf7-9d60-b09d30e43534.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16018227", "id": "16018227", "price": 180, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival.
