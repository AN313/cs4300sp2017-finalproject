{"description": "My place is close to AquaMarina, Marcha cocina bar, Columbia Wine Co, High Bridge Tower, and The High Bridge. You\u2019ll love my place because of the high ceilings, the location, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\nMy place is centrally located and very close to all forms of public tranportation including one block away from the A train which runs express and can get you to time square in  15-20 min.\n\nNear the cloisters and right in the middle of the Columbia University medical center and campus.\n\nThe A/C and 1 trains, and numerous buses. Only blocks from I-95 and the George Washington Bridge", "name": "Eclectic, relaxing yet steps away from the action", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b82ee0b6-2d14-4cee-8e34-a7d925e24567.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14952649", "id": "14952649", "price": 120, "review": "He made us feel home when we arrived.
