{"description": "My house sits on the historic district Prospect-Lefferts Garden. The uniqueness is not just the space but the neighborhood and its proximity to so many great Brooklyn things to see and  do and NYC things to see and do.  Transportation is very accessible to the city with buses and subways.  The apartment is located on the second floor of the townhouse.  Please read the house rules and contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThe apartment has two bedrooms, one with a queen sized bed and one with a full sized bed.  You can cook on two induction cooktops and put groceries in a small fridge.\n\nBathroom and kitchen.\n\nI will interact with guests daily if needed but they will have their privacy.\n\nI love Prospect Park, The Botanical Gardens, The Brooklyn Museum and the architecture from the early 1900s.  We have transportation that gets us all over the city.\n\nTransportation is great here in this neighborhood.  We have two subway lines that are two blocks away from me. Many things are within walking distance.", "name": "Beautiful, cozy apt in Lefferts Gardens Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4cb8feeb-101c-49e7-8de6-9df1e1868c62.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14227845", "id": "14227845", "price": 129, "review": "Robert is very accommodating and friendly and made me feel at home. The apartment is spacious and is being beautifully refurbished. Good bed, nice bathroom with great shower, large kitchen, etc. The apartment is located in an up and coming borough of Brooklyn and close to Prospect Park. Very nice. And very close to the subway + great coffee place right around the corner. All in all a great stay. I recommend. Thank you, Robert! "}
