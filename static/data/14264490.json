{"description": "Charming 3 BR apartment w sunny deck on delightfully quiet, tree-lined street in Windsor Terrace. Master BR + kids BR (with bunks) + well-equipped office and sunny, garden deck w/ grill. 12 min to Prospect Park, 5 min to Ft Hamilton F train. 40 min by F train to Soho. Very quiet, non-commercial area with a few good restaurants (Le Paddock, Brooklyn Commune, Della, Batata) but no shopping. Great for couples, solo travelers, families, but no more than 2 adults, 2 kids (not + adults). No pets.\n\nElegantly furnished with comfortable furniture, this book-filled apartment is perfect for a relaxing stay in Brooklyn. WiFi, AppleTV, a working office, an open kitchen, and a lovely garden deck (replete with gas grill and dining table), make this quiet, sunny apartment a great find.\n\nThe entire apartment is open but the children's room is reserved for children only.\n\nI will be reachable and my downstairs neighbors can help you.\n\nOn an utterly quiet, tree lined street, this apartment is terrific for light sleepers and people who love silence.", "name": "Sunny Windsor Terrace 3 BR + deck", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/244cabb9-cb27-4b51-a03a-e1b78ef21809.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14264490", "id": "14264490", "price": 120}
