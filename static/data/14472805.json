John was friendly and contactable via email on the day of check in. We did not meet or see John even though he has a private room in the apartment he respected our privacy. The apartment has all the basics although the wifi was sometimes a bit slow. There are great subway links nearby to all areas of the city. Not much going on in Harlem so we spent most of our time taking the subway but this was easy enough. The building has a doorman and felt safe. Altogether a very enjoyable stay."}
