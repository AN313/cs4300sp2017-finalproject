Soft lighting from paper mache lampshades and lanterns poised for evenings working, reading, laughing, and enjoying a meal. The apartment is 4 blocks from the JMZ trains and walking distance to local shops for used books, records, and clothes. Open 24/7 is Mr. Kiwi's food market that sells fresh juice for $3. More bars and shops walking distance!\n\nThere's a wonderful fire escape outside the kitchen window nearest to the bathroom door. You can sit and enjoy a cup of cocoa or tea on a brisk afternoon. Enjoy a selection of my books. Please don't take the books out of the apartment 3\n\nThere's a dresser drawer in the bedroom you will have access to store your clothes.
