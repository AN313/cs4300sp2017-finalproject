We experienced huge delays and Jeff waited until midnight for us and even met us at the taxi to help carry our bags. We had the kitchen, bathroom, lounge room & bedroom to ourselves, and didn't see Jeff again. But he is great at communicating and replied to text messages within minutes. The place is secure and has everything you need (pay tv, aircon, hair dryer, body wash etc.).\n\nTimes Square and broadway shows are around the corner and the whole area is super busy at all hours; some places are 24 hours. The Times Square Diner is 24 hours and a few minute walk away. The noise quickly becomes just background noise. We had a great stay. Thanks for everything Jeff!"}
