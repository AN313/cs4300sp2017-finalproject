{"description": "My place is close to Bryant Park, New York Public Library, Grand Central Terminal, 5th Ave, UN. You\u2019ll love my place because of the high ceilings and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travellers.\n\nOne Queen size bed and one queen size pull out bed. The room is an alcove with a small sleeping area separate from the living room.", "name": "Large Studio/one bed near Grand Central", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b6bbac84-a4bf-4318-9d3f-b1a417bdb032.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14772362", "id": "14772362", "price": 100, "review": "This place is so great! Hasan and his sister were so welcoming and made a very smooth arrival process, they've helped me to find the place although I never met them.\r\nThe location is awesome, just a few blocks away from Grand Central Terminal and from 51St.\r\nIt's a very quiet place even when you're in Midtown. It's nice, cozy and large, so comfortable... The listing is very accurate, and the place is well equipped, besides the regular stuff, you get a regular iron so you can iron your clothes if they arrive with some wrinkles ;) You get an AC unit too, very important in the hottest days of summer.\r\nI definitely recommend this place!"}
