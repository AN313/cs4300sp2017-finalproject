{"description": "Very sunny apartment in Chelsea.  Great location and good access to several subway lines.  There is a twin bed and another twin mattress on the trundle bed.  The kitchen is well equipped with pots and pans and utensils.  The bathroom is farther down the hallway past the kitchen.\n\nWe are staying elsewhere in New York during this time so we are both around if anything comes up. Feel free to message or text any questions.", "name": "Sunny Chelsea Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2a690ce6-26a7-46d0-937d-358072bc4328.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16253465", "id": "16253465", "price": 128, "review": "Ali an Amy were very kind and welcoming, they provided me information about the neighborhood. They answered my messages immediately and they waited me for the check-in although I was 1h and a half late. The apartment is very well located, tidy and clean. Great experience. Thank you."}
