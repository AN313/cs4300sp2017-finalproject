The place is in a GREAT location, and is big enough to sleep several people. The sink was clogged up, but it wasn't an issue since Larry was up front about it and so I didn't let it run. I appreciate that honesty! The place has really unique decorations which were fun to look at. One thing you should know when booking: there is a strong smell of smoke throughout. This wouldn't be an issue for many people, but it could be helpful to know going in. "}
