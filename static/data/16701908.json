{"description": "This is my living apartment and I book my vacations base on your booking! \n\nSince I do live here, I take really care of all my stuff and am choosy about who I invite in. All my belongings are here and that is why I require a deposit that I will return to you after I make sure everything is at where they are supposed to be.\n\nThe unit is located in a luxurious doorman building just half block away from the Queesboro Plaza Subway - it is just 10 mins (1 stop!) to Manhattan!\n\nThe place has comfy beds (1 queen size bed, 1 single mattress topper, and a small sofa that can host up to 4 people,) high ceilings, a kitchen, and the in-unit washer/dryer. The building has an amazing view, swimming pool and a gym you will be able to access.\n\nYou will not be able to use \n- My closets\n- My personal belonging (cloths, shoes, bags)\n- My liquor and wine\n\nEverything else is totally available!", "name": "Modern Sunny One Bedroom - 10 Mins to Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9bc03c89-f997-4ef1-8a5f-f128e86ff2ff.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16701908", "id": "16701908", "price": 119, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival.
