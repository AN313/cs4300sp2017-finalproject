{"description": "Awesome 1 Bedroom Apartment Available\n\nIt's a newly renovated, pre-war 1 bedroom apartment located right next door to the Grand Street L Subway Station in Williamsburg. \n\nMy place is close to Barcade, Le Barricou, Rye, and Pies-n-Thighs. You\u2019ll love my place because of the high ceilings and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nAlmost zero - if this place is on here it means I'm out of town. Don't worry! Local business will have the keys ready for you.\n\nRight by the Grand stop on the L train\n\nI'll have clean sheets, towels and toiletries for you. Just note- the couch in the living room does not fold out into a bed - it's just a regular old couch :)", "name": "1 Bedroom Apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6a002aeb-d353-492e-979d-3af7e6d2456d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14321059", "id": "14321059", "price": 59, "review": "Our stay in Jeff's flat was nice. Jeff was really available for us from the booking until the end of our stay. The flat look likes the pictures and is really well located. The only deception that we had is that the sofa is absolutely not a bed and cannot be arrange like a bed. So I wouldn't recommend this flat for 3 if the third person want to sleep well. Otherwise, everything was perfect so thank you for that. "}
