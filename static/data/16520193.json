{"description": "This centrally located Greenpoint apartment is on a quiet block with a garden view. The space is well organized for a single or couple, very comfortable with windows overlooking both the garden and Leonard Street. The neighborhood is central Greenpoint, one block from the G train and mainstays such as McCarren Park, Torst, Five Leaves, Nights and Weekends, Matchless, and countless cafes and shops. The Nassau G is steps away and it's about a 10 min walk to the Bedford L and central Williamsburg.", "name": "Private, Ideally Located Greenpoint Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bdfb53d0-ce9b-4a6e-a236-d75b8dd539e9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16520193", "id": "16520193", "price": 75, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival.
