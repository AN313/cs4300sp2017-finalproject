{"description": "Irving Place is a local neighborhood close to Union Square with tons of interesting restaurants / bars.  It is away from heavy midtown tourist crowds, so you will get a real taste for what it feels like to be a New Yorker.\n\nThe apartment is a huge, renovated and sunny studio with 24 hour doorman security.  It is also fully furnished with a fully equipped kitchen. \nI know you will love the space!\n\nEntire apartment (living area, sleeping area, kitchen, bathroom, laundry room)\n\nI'm always available to help with directions and questions.  I also love to recommend restaurants and local hangouts!\n\nIrving Place is a unique neighborhood with tons of small restaurants and local wine bars / coffee shops.  Id be happy to recommend a few places!  Check out Casa Mono and Bar Jamon, which are unique tapas bars right downstairs from the apartment!  It is also steps away from Union Square, where you can find Whole Foods and tons of other shops as well as full access to several major metro train lines.  The apartment is a five minute walk to fifth avenue shops as well.  It is a truly chic neighborhood where you will get insight into local life without being too far from major NYC sites!\n\nUnion Square metro station is a 3 minute walk from the apartment.  You can take trains to anywhere in the city from here.", "name": "Large Sunny Union Square Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c63583d-1ef2-4c07-9019-116e27bf6c20.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16630172", "id": "16630172", "price": 149, "review": "Wonderful apartment and friendly host!
