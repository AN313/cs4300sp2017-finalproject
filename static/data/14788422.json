{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place it's a typical New York spacious brownstone house with very high ceilings in a quiet area. My place is good for couples, business travelers, and families (with kids). My place is close to Public Transport (Subway Q, 4,5 & 6), Central Park, Metropolitan Museum, MoMA museum, the mansion of the NY mayor, and lots of bars and restaurant in UES.\n\nThis railroad apartment has a living room, bed room and a dining room - lots of space :)\n\nGuest have acces to the whole apartment which includes 3 rooms (railroad), a kitchen, a bathroom and a toilet.\n\nUpper East Side is safe, close to lots of interesting places and very beautiful and green.\n\nThere's plenty of options to get around including subway, bus, public bicycles and car rentals. Parking is available on the street. The new Q-subway just opened which give you easy access to Downtown, Times Square, Brooklyn, Coney Island and many other places. In addition the 4,5,6-subway brings you to Grand Central, downtown, Brooklyn, Harlem and the Bronx (Yankee Stadium). I would also recommend using the Citi-bikes, it's nice to go cycling in Central Park :)\n\nIt's a beautiful historic house and rare to find such a large apartment in the Upper East Side of New York :) Madonna lives two blocks away in a nice brownstone apartment :)", "name": "Spacious two bed room apt (850sf, 80m2)", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8cbd7c76-90bd-45aa-b09d-221f3c305ffe.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14788422", "id": "14788422", "price": 203, "review": "It was a very nice and cozy place. Except for the fact that the living room is one of the bedrooms and there is nothing but a see through door with curtains, the place is really good. But over all Arend was very nice and accommodating so we enjoyed our stay. Thanks Arend."}
