{"description": "A cozy and comfortable studio in the heart of Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It comfortably fits two and is located minutes away from the Barclay Center. Easy access to all major subway and bus lines. Two stops away from Manhattan. place is close to BAM Peter Jay Sharp Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Greenlight Bookstore. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nYou will access to the kitchen for cooking purposes. Private bathroom and shower. Plus Wi-Fi.\n\nI will be there to handoff the keys but since I won't be staying there guests won't see me much. But I am always a call away and answer all questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nYou can grab a train to pretty much everywhere. It's a two minute walk or less to the G, C, R, N, D, Q, B, 2, 3, 4, 5 trains. It's also a three minute walk to the Barclay Center.", "name": "Cozy Downtown Brooklyn Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b55a9a79-87a8-45c0-9775-d19a5f30860b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14691598", "id": "14691598", "price": 115, "review": "Nice and cozy!
