{"description": "Welcome to our sunny top floor apartment in lovely Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn! Our apartment is the full top floor of 2-family wood frame house, completely renovated and featuring a dishwasher, mini split A/C system, spacious shower, and gorgeous hardwood floors. We (your hosts) are the only other occupants of the house \u2014 we live on the garden floor, with a completely separate entrance.\n\nThis apartment is perfect for anyone traveling to Brooklyn for a weekend trip or looking for a longer sublet \u2014 it's a one bedroom, one bathroom apartment that spans the full top floor of a circa 1900 wood frame house, with fantastic sunlight, beautiful white oak hardwood floors, and lots of (brand-new) windows. \n\nIn the main living space, we have a comfy day bed and chair for lounging, along with 42\" TV equipped with basic cable and a Roku with Netflix (and you can log in to your favorite subscription services). There's also WiFi throughout the apartment. (The day bed can pull out into what basically becomes a king sized bed, and we have plenty of extra pillows.)\n\nOn the other end of the living space you'll find a dining area/kitchenette with  brand new appliances, including an electric stove (that works great!) and a dishwasher. We also have some pots and pans if you want to cook a bit, and a microwave if you need to reheat your dinner leftovers (tons of awesome places to eat/order takeout from nearby!) \n\nThe bedroom is not huge, but it fits a queen sized bed just fine, and three windows provide lots of sunlight. The bed has a Tempurpedic mattress topper so it's nice and cozy! \n\nThe bathroom might be the best part of the apartment \u2014 like the rest of the apartment it's newly renovated and has a double sink vanity, huge mirror, big standup shower, subway tile, and a gorgeous penny tile floor.  \n\nWe're the only other residents of the house, and we live on the garden floor.  So you'll enjoy your own entrance and total privacy, but we're only a few flights of stairs away if you need us!\n\nYou'll have your own private entrance up one flight of stairs from the street level.\n\nWe work regular business hours so we're not around much during weekdays and we try to give guests privacy when we're home.
