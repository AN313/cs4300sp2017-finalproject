I had an issue while staying, I sent a message to Kamil, and told him he could take care of it the next day but he had someone come out Christmas Day. Didn't get it resolved to my liking but there was an attempt.  The place was clean and quiet. I checked out a day early and sent him a text when I left and left the keys in the room.\nIt's best to have your own transportation, but there is a coffee shop, grocery and a couple of great restaurants in walking distance. \n\n"}
