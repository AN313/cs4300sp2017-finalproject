{"description": "Hi word traveler, I hope your enjoy this apartment, is artsy and has much love put on it. My place is close to Central Park and 5th Avenue . You\u2019ll love it because of the coziness and the location. There are 3 metro lines in the area (4,5,6 ; F and N,Q,R,W), the F and Q is less than 10 min by walk. The area is really quiet and with a lot of real new yorkers even though it is close to touristic places. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers as I am one myself. Be very welcome !\n\nIts is great, quiet and with a lot of good restaurants. And, close enough to walk to the 5th Avenue and Central Park.", "name": "Cozy Studio close to Central Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f8759843-1521-49ae-97b3-491a9cb2ed9c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15955392", "id": "15955392", "price": 99, "review": "Me and my boyfriend stayed at Al\u00e9xia's apartment for 7 nights and it was great. It is close to central park and to the sub station. The apartment is not really big, but you have everything you need. We didn't meet Al\u00e9xia, but she always responded really when we had any questions. I would devently definitely recommend the apartment for people who wants to explore the City and are looking for a stay! "}
