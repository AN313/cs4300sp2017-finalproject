Bryan's place absolutely exceeded our expectations! The location was PERFECT (Close to transit, food, and shops), the apartment was so quiet, and the place was spacious enough for the two of us to move around freely. I would highly recommend Bryan's place if you are looking for a quiet place to rest after a busy day in the city!"}
