{"description": "My place is 3 blocks from the Broadway Junction station (A,C, J and L). You can be in Manhattan in 30 minutes. It's also close to several grocery stores and green spaces including Highland Park. The apartment is flooded with sunlight all day - there are blinds that let the light in while maintaining privacy. Although the J train runs next to my building, my apartment is on the opposite side of the building so the noise is not bad. You'll have the place to yourself with code and key access.", "name": "Cozy private studio just 3 blocks from subway", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/980e70a8-e526-42a5-ae0c-94417adfe8a5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15286307", "id": "15286307", "price": 90, "review": "It is a beautiful studio.
