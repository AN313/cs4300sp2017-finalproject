{"description": "My place is close to beautiful Prospect Park and delicious Caribbean food. The subway is half a block away (B and Q lines).. You\u2019ll love my place because of the light and the coziness. No street noise - just the occasional above  ground train. And you'll get a beautiful sunset every night! . My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).", "name": "Light and Airy Uber-Studio near trains and park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dd173cba-bce9-4e34-bfde-0720a123e834.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15373494", "id": "15373494", "price": 65}
