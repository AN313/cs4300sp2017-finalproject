{"description": "My place is close to The Brooklyn Museum, Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Library, Franklin Ave, Prospect Park. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the light, the outdoors space, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). We have an adorable cat named Meow and someone will be by to feed him and scoop the litter each day.", "name": "Prospect Heights for the Holidays! 2 bedroom apt", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/88214418-6233-469d-9ec3-b3ff6b0448ff.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14317785", "id": "14317785", "price": 125, "review": "Julie's place is a great value for the location and space. The apartment, which we had to ourselves, was the perfect base camp for exploring Brooklyn and beyond. It is literally a five minute walk to the 2/3 trains, and there are plenty of buses near her place. Don't miss Riverdel (a vegan cheese shop with excellent sandwiches) and the Brooklyn Museum!\n\nOne thing to note: If you aren't used to city noises, make sure to bring earplugs for sleeping. I live in a city and still found them to be beneficial."}
