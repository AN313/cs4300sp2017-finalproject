{"description": "This charming East Village Zen Den is the perfect balance to the hustle and bustle of the electric city that never sleeps! The quintessential NYC exposed brick from the 1800's will add depth and authenticity to your stay in the Big Apple. Just three blocks from the historical Tompkins Square Park, a short walk from the East River, one stop from Williamsburg, BK, and within walking distance of Union Square and all major train lines, this gem is perfectly located for all your big city needs.\n\nYou\u2019ll be welcomed by dimly lit crystals and salt lamps and glowing Buddhas to the distant fragrance of soothing aromatherapy. Please do light the candles in the fireplace and enjoy the warmth, peace, and serenity this magical place has to offer. There\u2019s a large tea selection above the stove, and a wine shop just downstairs. We have plenty of plants and salt lamps improving the air quality (and esthetics!) of your stay! And while we have the best pots, pans, herbs and spices for cooking, nobody ever uses them because we live within walking distance of some of the best food in the world!\n \nWith prisms lining the windows, you\u2019re more than likely to wake up to rainbows everywhere. The luxurious bed is the most commonly noted feature of this palace. The pillow-top mattress is by designer Vera Wang and the memory-foam pillows are made of organic bamboo, so they\u2019re both breathable and correctively comfortable. We live in a surprisingly quiet building in the heart of East Village and Alphabet City!\n \nHave a wonderful time!", "name": "Enchanting East Village Zen Den", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/034c51c0-3413-45a9-ac63-922b69363652.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16193891", "id": "16193891", "price": 130, "review": "The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.
