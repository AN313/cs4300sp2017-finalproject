The area was quiet and cozy. The apartment was super close to the subway, about 5 minutes and Starbucks right by it too! The only thing to mention is that the apartment is on the 4th floor and the building doesn't have an elevator. If you don't mind the climb up, this is a perfect place to stay! "}
