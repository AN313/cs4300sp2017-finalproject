{"description": "Nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, between Caf\u00e9 Dante and Mermaid Oyster Bar, my apartment is perfectly located for access to some of the best restaurants and bars in the city, Washington Square Park, Comedy Cellar, and is a short walk from Soho.  The apartment is of a suitable size for a solo traveler or couple, and was recently renovated.  \n\nNote that the apartment is located on the 7th floor of a walk-up building, but on the plus side, it is quiet, and gets lots of natural light.", "name": "Greenwich Village Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/133dfb9f-b0c8-49d9-9a6a-4b9d302f86bb.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16037130", "id": "16037130", "price": 135, "review": "Michaels place made you feel right at home in the heart of Greenwich Village. It is central to many unique restaurants and bars. It is only a short walk to the closest subway station. The people in Greenwich Village are some of the nicest and most accommodating people we have ever met! Staying in this apartment makes you feel as if you are part of the community! Michael made the check in process extremely easy and was so flexible with our check in and check out times. He responded quickly to all of our questions and even provided us a contact in the building in case something went wrong. The apartment was recently renovated and extremely spacious compared to some of the other places we looked at staying. The only thing to remember when staying here is that it is on the 7th floor which makes carrying up luggage quite a job. Luckily we only stayed the weekend so we packed lite. I cannot say enough good things about this place. If you are looking at staying in this area you definitely need to give this place a try! "}
