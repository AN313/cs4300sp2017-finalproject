I had a great, hassle-free stay for two nights. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, cozy and it was spotless when arrived. It's great for relaxing if you've been out and about all day and has all the amenities you could want. Molly was a gracious, responsible and responsive host. I felt like she was at hand even though she was away. It was super easy to get the keys, find and access the apartment. The location is to die for. I could not believe how quick and easy it was to get to and from Manhattan. And the neighbourhood has no shortage of places to get food at all hours. If you're a light sleeper you may want to bring earplugs, as you might be woken by some early-morning street noise. Or the sofa is also super comfortable, I was even tempted to sleep there!"}
