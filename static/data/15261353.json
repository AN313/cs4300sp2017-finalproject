{"description": "Our spacious corner apartment located in the Kips Bay/Murray Hill neighborhood is ideal for a couple or a few friends on a New York vacation!\n\nOur apartment faces away from the street in a quiet elevator building.  Laundry access in the basement (approx. $3.50 per load) and a large kitchen (by New York standards) makes it ideal for longer stays. The sleeping area is separated by a few steps and large bookcase for added privacy. The queen size air mattress for third guest takes up the better part of the living area when inflated. Full bathroom with tub/shower. Separate wall-mounted air conditioning units in living and sleeping areas.\n\nOur east side neighborhood provides easy access to the best of New York and a quiet place to sleep at night. Central to all the quintessential Manhattan sites. Numerous bars, restaurants, and delis within a 5-min walk, as well as Fairway and Trader Joe's for groceries. Short bus/train/cab/bike ride from the Lower East Side, East Village, SoHo, and West Village.\n\nWe prefer to ride bikes or walk most places (two bicycles included with the apartment), but there are lots of transportation options:\n\nSUBWAY/TRAINS:\nThe apartment is closest to the 6 train, which runs from Brooklyn to the Bronx along Manhattan's East Side. It is also less than a mile from Grand Central and Penn Stations, which connect you to almost every train that passes through New York. \n\nBUSES:\nReliable buses run along the avenues (M103) and 34th Street (M34). \n\nTAXIS:\nIt is easy to hail a cab along 2nd or 3rd Avenues any time of day or night. All yellow cabs accept major credit cards. Many people use Uber or Lyft as well.", "name": "Sunny Studio in Midtown Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e39ca6a8-99d9-4204-a981-1f6e2135703d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15261353", "id": "15261353", "price": 128}
