{"description": "The Lower East Side is a great spot for solo adventurers and young couple, one of Manhattan's fashionable neighborhoods with tons of restaurants, bars and boutiques. Though you'll still find a few survivors of its Jewish origins like Katz's Deli, an icon of the LES. \nOur place is spacious and bright thanks to the east-facing windows. We have all the comforts you need such as wifi, TV and a Nespresso machine, a super cosy queen-sized bed and a comfy sofa that can be used for extra sleeping space.", "name": "Spacious Apartment in the Heart of LES", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b71c56a9-7f80-43d2-9105-dcfe565e244f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14183900", "id": "14183900", "price": 228, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival.
