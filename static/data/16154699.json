In regards to his place. Our review would be a low 3 out of 5. It lacked basic amenities, cleanliness & a place that looked like it isn't care for much. Basically a place to sleep. We gave our thoughts on how he could inexpensively and quickly improve his apt to help & get better reviews in the future. Hopefully he will. "}
