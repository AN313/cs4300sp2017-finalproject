{"description": "My place is close to Bloomingdales. You\u2019ll love my place because of The Upper East Side location, the people and easy access to several subways such as: 4, 5, 6, N, Q, R, and the F train.  Close to the local grocery store, Whole Foods is only a few blocks away and a Duane Reade is on the corner.  You are 4 blocks to Central Park.", "name": "Sun drenched lg. studio alcove renovated UES", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9e7b1b64-5a15-4f1a-a69c-ae4b77ef4826.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14779757", "id": "14779757", "price": 250}
