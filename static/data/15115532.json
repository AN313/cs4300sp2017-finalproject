{"description": "My place is close to Madison Square park, very centric only 3 blocks from the subway (6 Line on 28th and Park) and only 3 blocks to Madison Square park and the historic Flatiron building. This is a cozy studio which can sleep up to 4. The living room couch is built into a murphy bed, very easy to bring up and down and very comfortable mattress. This is a duplex studio so there is another divided space with a futon, next to the dining room table which sleeps 2 more and is also very comfortable.", "name": "Cozy Duplex Studio in Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fe7f060e-68aa-49a5-a3f1-386e9289b361.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15115532", "id": "15115532", "price": 163, "review": "Lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan, definitely a great place to stay for a weekend in the Big Apple!\nThe apartment is fully furnished and although it can fit 4 people, I'd say 3 persons max gives more room for everyone.\nOverall, we had a great stay here, thanks a lot for hosting us!"}
