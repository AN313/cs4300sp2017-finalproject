She was very thoughtful from the beginning. My plane was delayed so I couldn't arrive at the time we had schedule but she found a way to bring me the keys. She asked me how I was and how was everything and she answer all my questions immediately. The place is well located in a nice zone and has lots of places to buy food and stuff you need for the apartment. It is beautiful and well equipped it even had sheets and towels. Everything is clean and organized. I will definitely recommend this place and if I have the chance to go back to New York I wouldn't doubt to stay again at Bjork's place."}
