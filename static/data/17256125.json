{"description": "Hi guys! Welcome to my page. I live in the heart of Greenwich village. Just a 2 blocks to the heart of Soho and a 10 minute walk to the famous Meatpacking District.  My apartment is perfect for people coming to NYC to be in a great neighborhood, near great restaurants and the best shopping. Please message me with any questions. \n\nLast Renovation - 2016 (bathroom & kitchen)", "name": "Heart of Greenwich Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b91bd136-1ea6-4df7-b1d3-54f7effcdecb.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17256125", "id": "17256125", "price": 210}
