{"description": "Cheerful, bright and sunny studio apartment in the heart of Nolita. Surrounded by New York City\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods, Soho, The East Village and Little Italy. My home is on the 5th floor of a doorman building (with elevator access), giving it both quiet and great sunlight.\n\nBright, sunny, and cozy. This is where you want to spend your holidays. As you enter your holiday home, say hi to my doorman who is there to greet you at the end of a long day exploring all the sites the city has to offer. Take the elevator up to the fifth floor where my newly designed home awaits you for rest and respite in a truly NY experience.\n\nMy home is yours! If you need anything, please make yourself welcome.\n\nI'll be traveling during your stay, so I've hired Cityami as my co-host while I'm away. They'll reach out to you shortly after booking and are there to answer any and every question you have. They're all locals and can help you plan your stay or simply answer questions about the functionality of my home.\n\nMy studio is near the corner of Mulberry and Spring street and is in close proximity to multiple subway lines, cozy cafes, decadent restaurants, art and design galleries, and the best shopping NYC has to offer - from high end boutiques to local designers, they\u2019re all located within minutes of the apartment.\n\nMy apartment has incredible access to nearly every train in NYC. The B, D, F, M, 6, R, W, J and Z trains are all within 5 minutes walking of the apartment. The C and E trains are about 10 minutes away.\n\nThe apartment is very quiet by NYC standards, but you will still hear the occasional ambulance or night time party-goer. If you're a light sleeper, I recommend choosing a location further uptown or in Brooklyn (where residential and business areas are generally kept separate).", "name": "Magnificent Studio Near Little Italy NYC!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19e83d2d-5218-4bfa-973b-4d32b3802a2c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15566451", "id": "15566451", "price": 165, "review": "Every thing perfect \nLocation , apartment \nWe had wonderful time \nThanks "}
