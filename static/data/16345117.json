{"description": "Located in the heart of Bushwick between the L and the JMZ, we've made our home a fun retreat set in a classic Brooklyn railroad. The apartment is just steps from countless neighborhood bars & restaurants, and has a bright and spacious bedroom, cozy living room, great (big!) kitchen, and the 'flower' room (our little work room/guest room that can be appointed with a deluxe air bed for additional guests).\n\nSpacious 1 bedroom apartment located in amazing area of Bushwick in Brooklyn, NYC!\n\nAmazing restaurants, art galleries, artists studios, all around the neighborhood with sites to see!\n\nVery close to subway stations Morgan Avenue L train, and Myrtle/Broadway JMZ train stations.\n\n15-20 minute train ride to Union Square station\n15-20 minute train ride to Lower East Side Delancey Station\n\nThe unit is located in a pre-war building, there are some unique and quirky details! That being said, our bathroom has just a shower/tub and a toilet-- it does not have a sink... Its strange, I know, but hopefully not a deterrent from having you stay with us in such a beautiful space! As we like to think about it, the tub is a very large sink!  :P We just wash our hands in the tub or the nearby kitchen sink :)", "name": "Lovely Brooklyn Apartment for March!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6b0a2820-9aa7-4b9c-b17b-121ab1074f15.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16345117", "id": "16345117", "price": 120, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival.
