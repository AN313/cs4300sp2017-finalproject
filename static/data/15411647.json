{"description": "My place is close to Church Fruit Farm Inc (24 hr fruit and vegetable stand). Were also close to Prospect Park, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Downtown Natural Market, Kings Theatre, Jus Juice, Trini Breakfast Shed II, Strictly Vegetarian Restaurant. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the kitchen, the breakfast options, The comfy reclining chairs. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families.\n\nWe have anything that you could possibly think of to make your stay feel more like being at home at no extra cost.\n\nI am always available to my guest. When I am not at work I am right next door. My husband is also available next door to help with any requests 24 hrs.\n\nI love having a 24 hr Farmers Market at the corner. I can always go there if I need something, or if I get the cooking bug at 2 am.\n\nThe B 35  bus is right down the block on church avenue, the 2 train is walking distance from the house on Church and Nostrand Avenue", "name": "Feel at Home!
