He was the best host; he greeted us early in the morning and graciously set us all up. The apartment was ideal and extremely clean, with an amazing private backyard. Location can't be beat in the heart of Greenwich Village with the best restaurants and shops down the street and picturesque scenes wherever you turn. \r\n\r\nBottom line: Jon and this apartment were terrific and you should book it if you get the chance!"}
