{"description": "If you need an escape while still being in the center of everything. Then this one bedroom apt is for you. It has been recently updated but there is always room for improvement. Its 7 blocks from central park and walking distance from mass transit\n\nThe space comes with its own separate entrance, wifi with access to netflix. Plus for those people who prefer to make their own meals. The Apt has a fully functional kitchen with a gas range.\n\nI can be there if you need me, but I rather my guests enjoy living in an nyc apt without too much interruptions.\n\nI love the access that one has to the city by living in the area. While your a short 4 train stops away from Times Square, your also a bus ride away from       LaGuardia Airport. You can hop on a bike and take a ride through Central Park or you can take a stroll and stop into any one of the bars lounges or eateries in the area.\n\nThe space is close to the 2,3,B,C and you can easily connect to the 4,5,6,A,D, and the metro north.", "name": "One bedroom escape", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8cf2283-f1a9-4006-bc4c-fe86238e52b6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16014708", "id": "16014708", "price": 135, "review": "Nous n'avons pas vu Chuck mais \u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 toute nos questions.\nLa wifi fonctionne mais coupe parfois, l'appartement n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s propre \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e.
