{"description": "There are numerous cozy cafes close to my bright studio apartment and the neighbourhood is known for its wonderful range of restaurants. There are bars close by with live music and entertainment and a number of parks to choose from. There is a convenient grocery store and health food stores on my street, bakery and a nice wine shop. The N/W train is near with quick and easy connection to Manhattan. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nI will be away and leave the place to you to enjoy, but you can contact me by email which I check several times a day.\n\nThe N/W train is just a five minute walk away up Broadway and takes you through Lexington Av, Times Square, Herald Square, Union Square, East Village, Soho and into Brooklyn with easy connections to other trains\n\nCross streets: Crescent and Broadway\n\nThe bed option in the system was only Queen, but it is actually Full size Casper mattress which is a little smaller. The air mattress is double and has an electric pump, and I also have a couple inch thick Casper memory foam style mattress topper to make it more comfortable.\n\nI like to keep the place as spacious as possible so I tuck my dining table away unless guests come over, but it takes seconds to set up!\n\nThere isn't a laundromat in the building, but there are two options a few footsteps away - one of them I prefer cause they have Bakeway cafe right next to it for quality affordable coffee but also The Strand which often have live music.\n\nYou're welcome to use all equipment. Gas stove, the oven, kitchenaid blender, french press, microwave, hairdryer etc.", "name": "Bright, cozy studio in Astoria", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c3afc70f-45b9-4aff-b751-c3b91dad0d3e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15997880", "id": "15997880", "price": 76, "review": "We really enjoyed our stay at the studio. It is very centrally located with restaurants, shops and subway stops quite close. The studio was very clean and looks just as pictured. The shower stays nice and hot, learning to get it to the right temp is tricky the first time, but not hard. Eva was a wonderful host who met us kind of late for check-in because my flight didn't come in till nighttime and even saved us when we locked ourselves out.  If you are driving, parking can be hard because there are certain hours that are no parking for street cleaning and trash cleanup so we did have to move the car daily during the week. Most of the time it wasn't difficult to find a new spot. It's not an issue during the weekend. "}
