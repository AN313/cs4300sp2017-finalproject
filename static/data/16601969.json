{"description": "My place is close to some of the best bars and restaurants in the city, including: Caracas Arepa Bar, Esperanto, Katz Deli, Russ and Daughters, Mr. Purple, and bars and restaurants galore. You\u2019ll love my place because of the outdoor space, and the location and proximity to hot neighborhoods including: Alphabet City, Lower East Side, Nolita, Soho, West Village, Williamsburg, etc. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nOur apartment is cute, cozy and comfortable.  You will have access to a single bedroom, the kitchen, common area, bathroom and outdoor space.  The outdoor space is private and has views overlooking the beautiful street view below (and private courtyards on the opposite side).  The windows are large and provide nice views of the street below.\n\nYou will have access to assistance as needed during your stay for any issues under short notice.\n\nThe East Village/Lower East Side is one of the most up and coming areas in the city and is perfect for couples or singles looking to maximize their visit.\n\nThe apartment is on the same corner as an M15SBS express bus which provides access to much of the city. The F train subway line is one block away giving access to Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, as well as to all the other subway lines. Additionally, 1st ave is a large thoroughfare and provides access to many cabs.", "name": "Beautiful Downtown Apartment w/ Huge Private Patio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f7470a86-ff60-455e-b5ea-45b616916353.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16601969", "id": "16601969", "price": 120, "review": "Mikes an awesome host. the apt is convenient and close to much of what's happening in NYC. the patio is also great for entertaining a couple friends.
