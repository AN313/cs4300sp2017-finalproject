{"description": "Perfect location to rent for the NYC holiday season! It is located on a classic tree lines block in Park Slope...just a few blocks from Prospect Park, which features ice skating and farmers markets. Just 1 block from the R train and about 5 blocks from the F train, which will get you into Manhattan in about 15-20 minutes.  About 5 minutes from the now famous Barclays Center.  Surrounded by great restaurants, bars and shops.  The apt has a fantastic kitchen, washer/dryer and lots of space!", "name": "Great 1 Bedroom in the heart of Brooklyn!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/01f8a0ca-e002-4944-b144-8beb63441a5d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15453096", "id": "15453096", "price": 115, "review": "Great, clean space.
