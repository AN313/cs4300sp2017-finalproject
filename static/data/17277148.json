{"description": "My place is comfortable and scenic. There is a 24 hr doorman. The apartment is very close to the Kingston C subway station (approximately 2 blocks). It is also close to Foodtown, Barclay's Center, Downtown Brooklyn, Saraghina. You\u2019ll love my place because of the best view of Manhattan from a PRIVATE terrace, the coziness, the kitchen. Good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nThere is a separate kitchen with  stools and a bar, a room with a queen sized bed, a couch and a desk for working. There is also a hair dryer available, as well as an electric skillet.\n\nYou will be able to access the gym, private terrace and washer and dryer.\n\nI am really knowledgeable about where to go and find the best deals in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood is very trendy with cafes and restaurants in surrounding blocks. There is a dollar tree directly downstairs, which will give you access to basic needs.\n\nIt is very easy to take the train from my apartment. There are also citibikes for rent directly across the street.", "name": "Apartment with Private Beautiful Terrace, W/D", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/648426b5-18f9-48d7-b666-7346512cc219.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17277148", "id": "17277148", "price": 99}
