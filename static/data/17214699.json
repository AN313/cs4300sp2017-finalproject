I used to live in NYC for years and I love this neighborhood. Hope was a fantastic host. I drove in late and she still waited for me to check me in personally. She even helped me with finding Street parking. Her house is super clean, which I greatly appreciate. It was around the corner from the R train station at Union St. which takes you to all the major stops in the City. To sum up, I would definitely recommend anybody to stay with Hope and I will definitely be back!"}
