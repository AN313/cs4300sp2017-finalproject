The spot originated as a hangout where surfers could store their boards and commune. This year they offer barbecue and brunch out of a food truck parked in the yard, which is outfitted with handcrafted reclaimed-wood tables, bamboo, sunflowers, and murals painted by local artists and neighborhood kids. An ecstatic flowering skull extolls the mantra \u201cLive Surf Die.\u201d The chef, Patrick Quinn, designed the menu of beer-boiled peanuts in the shell, sriracha-honey smoked wings, vinegar-doused pulled pork, and masa-crusted shrimp po\u2019boys. There\u2019s also a tender kale salad with specks of quinoa and ultra-summery grilled watermelon with mint pesto.\"(URL HIDDEN)The New Yorker Magazine\n\nSAYRA'S WINE BAR:\n\"Ms. Jackson's (the owner) recommended pairings: the spicy homemade meatballs in tomato basil sauce ($7) with the malbec, and the pepper turkey sandwich made with cranberry dressing ($7) with the lambrusco. The smoked paprika and rosemary salt chips ($2) and the marinated olives ($3) are good to share. A happy-hour special offers pulled-pork sliders with a can of Narragansett beer for $12.(URL HIDDEN)The Wall Street Journal\n\nUMA'S RESTAURANT AND BAR:\n\"Typically congregated in insular outer-borough enclaves, Uzbeki restaurants have been slow to cross into the mainstream. Uma\u2019s, located on Rockaway Beach\u2019s incipient restaurant row, might be the first. The location works: How better, after all, to cap off a day of carving waves than with a hearty bowl of the noodle soup called lagman, ground-beef lula kebabs, and plov, the oil-varnished rice pilaf and Uzbekistan\u2019s national dish? Uma\u2019s has a bit of surfer-dude soul, too, and caters to its inevitable vegetarian clientele with butternut-squash manti; greens-stuffed pastries called bichaki; and a house salad of fried eggplant, ripe tomatoes, and feta cheese.\"(URL HIDDEN)The New York Magazine Food Guide\nTHE WHIT'S END PIZZA:\n\"Aycock (the owner) pushes his customers to read his menu, even if they\u2019ve never heard of ingredients like rapini, taleggio, or fior di latte. For the dough, Aycock uses only Caputo flour imported from Naples. His olive oil and tomatoes are imported from Italy. He grinds Berkshire pork belly to make sausage infused with a Tuscan spice mix. He uses a blend of buffalo mozzarella and fior di latte, a cow\u2019s milk cheese, to lend lightness to his finished pies. Garlic comes from a farm upstate, shiitake mushrooms come from a mysterious forager who digs around abandoned fisheries on the Hudson.(URL HIDDEN) The Grub Street\n\nTHAI ROCK BAR AND RESTAURANT:\n\" Kaskel (owner) offers \u201creal Thai cuisine, not watered-down, Americanized Asian cuisine\u201d with dishes in the $8 to $20 range, and to ensure the food is literally home-cooked, he has rented the apartments above the restaurant to three cooks who used to work in Manhattan. Four menus change with the seasons (soups and stews during the winter, lighter fare during the summer) and there are performances seven days per week in the summer.(URL HIDDEN)The New York Magazine Food Guide\n\nSubway A Train (an incredible $2.75 per ride in any direction) takes you to JFK Airport in under 10 mins and to Manhattan in under one hour. To travel to Long Island take Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), or rent a car, or taxi, or Uber. For specific times and services please check out MTA website. Our city never sleeps, so subway runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you are planning to stay late at night in Manhattan please check if any maintenance works on the subway might cause delays coming back home.\n\nWe are warm, generous and open minded people, both educators. Your satisfaction is our top priority. \n\nIn the summer season, due to heavy bookings, our check in time is 4:00 pm and check out 10:00 am. This allows us to prep the house for next guests and have some respite from hosting. Absolutely no check in after midnight. If you have nowhere else to go and need us to meet you at the door, there will be additional charge of $100. To avoid expense and/or emotional burnout please plan your trip accordingly. \n\nEating out in New York City can quickly add up. Yet, cooking your own meals can be tiresome on vacation. Please, let us know, if you would like us to serve you breakfast and/or supper. Our rates are: $5 per person breakfast and $10 per person supper. We will simply add this to your total price, if you let us know ahead of time.  \n\nPlease, exercise ultimate discretion when walking through the development. It is a Home Owners Association and neighbors are extremely sensitive to slightest disturbance of peace. Please, do not throw garbage, break parking rules, or talk loudly. Display your parking permit we gave you on the rear view mirror of your car, facing the street, at all times, to avoid towing. Do not walk around in swimming suits to or from the beach, this is a beachfront development, not a resort. Dress fully, as you would in city streets.", "name": "ELEGANT NEW HOME @ ARVERNE BY THE SEA NEAR JFK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/af55e3cd-5b32-4de9-952f-69433bf104a6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14796074", "id": "14796074", "price": 299, "review": "I love Natasha's choice of linen for our bed.
