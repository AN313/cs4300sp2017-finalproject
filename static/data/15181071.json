It was my fourth time and her first adventure in the Big Apple. The apartment was lovely and comfortable for two people. The neighborhood was unique as well, just a few blocks from Central Park. Kathryn was very responsive from the moment we chatted about availability. I would highly recommend her place to anyone who wants a comfy, convenient spot away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but close enough to the train so you can easily get anywhere in the city during your stay."}
