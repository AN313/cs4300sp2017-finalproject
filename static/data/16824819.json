{"description": "My place is close to to the E/F train for a swift ride to midtown Manhattan (25 mins).  You can take a $7 Uber to Austin St. in Forest Hills for bars and nightlife.  The Long Island Rail Road is also there for a 15 min ride to Penn Station Manhattan. There is a terrace off the living room to enjoy a few minutes outside as well as a rooftop with views of the NYC Skyline.  The bedroom has a king sized tempur-pedic mattress  with a 80 inch TV in the living room.  Enjoy a great stay in NYC!", "name": "Great Location: Visit NYC and Enjoy", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1aeb22c5-724a-4f7a-9aaf-9e312d892e0d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16824819", "id": "16824819", "price": 85, "review": "Evan was great! He checked and asked if I need any help during my stay. I made myself feel like home , and cleaned up like I wasn't even there. I love his living room the most. Great size , awesome TV and cool fishes. I would definitely recommend staying at Evans."}
