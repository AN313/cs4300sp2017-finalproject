{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, and the cozy and unique style of the apartment. My place is super convenient and close to a variety of amazing and eclectic bars and restaurants like Paulie Gee's, The Bounty, Anella, Hail Mary, M Shanghai, Pencil Factory, Ovenly, Brooklyn Star, Ramona and Brooklyn Bazaar. There is tons to do and see just steps from the front door.  My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).\n\nOur apartment is old school Brooklyn.  If you're looking for ultra hip and chic this may not be the listing for you.  However, if you like quirky, cozy and homey you will love our place.\n\nThe entire apartment is yours (and ours).\n\nWe are available to help with anything and everything.\n\nWe are in Brooklyn's booming Greenpoint historic district.  The apartment is near the riverfront just north of Williamsburg.  Greenpoint is a beautiful and calm area full of amazing markets, unique shops, exciting bars and restaurants with tons of character and amazing food.  Our place is great for couples seeking an adventure and solo adventurers looking for excitement.  Get a real feel for Brooklyn life in this comfortable apartment in an amazing location.  This really is an amazing location in the center of EVERYTHING.\n\nThe front door of the building is steps from the Greenpoint Ave G train stop and bus's  and a couple blocks from the Greenpoint East River Ferry dock, with easy access to cabs.  Be in Queens or Manhattan in minutes.", "name": "Live Like a Local In GREENPOINT", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d3ace9ab-c6c7-4d6e-bc58-9b799963b506.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17045913", "id": "17045913", "price": 20, "review": "Locationally, this space is a 10/10 rental.  Proximity to Greenpoint public transportation, laundry, food, grocery, nightlife, laundry, and just about anything else you could want or need is pretty much unbeatable.  The only caveat is that being in such a centralised location does mean a little more noise all around.  (However, it could be argued that anyone looking to rent this place should probably be prepared for the bustle of a city anyway.)  Note: If you spend a lot of time in the kitchen, you might find it slightly subpar, but in every other area, this place is very well-stocked, charming, and inhabitable.  Holistically, this is a great place (with exceptional hosts) suitable for short and extended stays alike."}
