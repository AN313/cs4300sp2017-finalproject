Two blocks from Central Park, less than one block to the subway, near everything you need to make your stay in New York relaxed and memorable including the park across the street and a colorful bodega just a few steps away.\n\nIt's so close to the park and the subway!!!  Really super convenient to go into the city for all the sightseeing.\n\nMi casa es su casa!\n\nHelp yourself to anything in the fridge.\n\nFeel free to use all amenities, utensils, products, etc. except for the closet which is locked and off limits.\n\nYou'll have the place all for yourself.\n\nThere is a memorable archway vaulted underpass on the nearest corner and it leads the way to central park just two blocks away.  There is a small grassy park across the street, there are plenty of cats and dogs always milling around the area where the surrounding architecture has that iconic New York neighborhood building block feeling with a latin american spice, daily activity buzzing around a plethora of shops, cafes, bars, restaurants and small local businesses nearby, plus two church buildings on the same block, and the 6 subway line just down to the corner, you'll hear spanish during that 2 minute walk.\n\nSubway 6 line less than a block away.  \n\nSouthbound bus stops on Lexington, northbound on Madison Ave. \n\nParking on the street only.\n\nJust ask if you have any specific needs.", "name": "Entire Comfy 1B Studio near Central Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bae10df5-0d88-4b26-bb50-c9e3da32345e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16007759", "id": "16007759", "price": 81}
