{"description": "My place is in walking distance from all of the amazing restaurants, bars and cultural attractions of Harlem. There are grocery stores, bodegas/delis, coffee shops and many shopping options within a 2-5 min walk. New places open every day...Harlem really is the place to be!\nRed Rooster Harlem, Sylvia's Restaurant, Columbia University, Chez Lucienne, Corner Social. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThis is a lovely recently renovated and furnished garden-level apartment with its own private entrance. Located in an owner-occupied, Harlem brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined block. Our block is very safe and neighbor friendly. \nThe space comfortably sleeps up to 4 people.  You will find that we offer everything you need to make your stay in NYC perfect. Beautiful hardwood floors, large living room, kitchenette area has appliances (refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, tea pot), dishes & cutlery.\n\nI personally meet and welcome you and answer any questions that you may have upon your arrival. I will show you how to enter with your entry code and show you around the apartment. \nYou will have the entire apartment completely to yourself to enjoy throughout your stay.\nI live upstairs from the garden floor and I'm always available via phone/text/email if you need anything!\n\nWe are locate in arguably the most popular fast growing community in all of Manhattan.\nHarlem is a very exciting and diverse neighborhood with all different types of cultures and people, a true NYC UPTOWN MELTING POT... which means there is something all around to do here.  :-)\n\nIt's conveniently located near westside (A,B,C trains) and equal distance to (2/3) subways. Both are a 5-7 minute walk from the house and both will quickly get you to any other part of the city.  The Metro North railroad on 125th street and many bus lines are available (including the M60 bus to Laquardia Airport). Taxis are easily flagged on the avenues surrounding our block. Uber and other local car services are always just a phone call away.\nFree street parking... just obey the signs :-) \nThere is a parking garage around the corner\n\nI have live/owned this Harlem BrownStone for over 30 years and love what Harlem continues to blossom. I take a lot of pride in making sure that it will be just as good to you as it has been for me :-)", "name": "Cozy garden floor apartment-Brownstone", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4d0bcaf4-6d56-466d-adde-acc004d2bbe3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15994498", "id": "15994498", "price": 150, "review": "George was great! His home was just as expected. Very hospitable and communication. We had a problem with the door at first and he fixed it immediately! He also let us check in late since our flight was late as well. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks again George!"}
