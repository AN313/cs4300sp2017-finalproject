{"description": "This 1 bedroom apartment is literally off the 1 train - 15 minutes by train to Times Square and Midtown. 10 minute walk to Harlem and famously known Apollo Theatre. 15 minute walk to Columbia University. 20 minute walk to Central Park and right on Riverside Park. You\u2019ll love my place because of how easy it is getting to midtown and all other main attractions the city has to offer. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with kids).", "name": "1 bedroom apartment - 15 minutes to midtown", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3bb81323-b67e-4793-ad7a-9767058a834a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15707002", "id": "15707002", "price": 90, "review": "The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.
