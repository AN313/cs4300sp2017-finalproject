The apartment was a short walk to the subway. It's an older building and the place is a bachelor's pad style. \nWe had a few issues with the heating being way too hot and no clear instructions on how to turn it down. Our host provided only 2 pillows for the bed which were really flat and there was no blanket. So our sleeping experience wasn't all that great. I think with a few upgrades, it could be improved. The bathroom really needed a good cleaning. "}
