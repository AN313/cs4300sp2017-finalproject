{"description": "A beautiful sunlit apartment, right next to the train station. Not too far, not too close to the hustle of the city. Really nice neighborhood with great restaurants and bars. Close to Columbia University. \n\nSpacious, top floor of elevator building. Queen size super comfy bed with plush comforter, lovely kitchen, big couch, electric piano, some good books to read on the shelf. A special vibe-lots of love! I am a musician traveling often with Airbnb, excited to share my home with you!", "name": "Beautiful sunny home in New York", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7e0480a9-fc05-4f1a-aa01-6d12d2cfd944.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15963329", "id": "15963329", "price": 130, "review": "Sebastian is a very caring host, he even texted us during our stay to ask if everything is ok or if we need something. At the same time he perfectly respects guests privacy.\nThe apartment is perfect for a couple, not too big, not too small. All basic equipment is in the apartment and works, including air conditioning. Maybe a coffee machine was something we missed but it wasn't a big problem for us.\nOne of the most important things is the spot where Sebastians place is located. It is literally around the corner of Subway Station when no 1 trains stop every 5 minutes. It let's you get to the Central Par in 15 minutes or so. At the same time the apartment is pretty quiet and trains don't bother you at night.\nI definitely recommend Sebastian as a host and his apartment as a place to stay.\n\nPS: As the appartment is located on the sixth floor you CAN go to the roof and have a picknick there on warm evenings!"}
