{"description": "Newly renovated and spacious 1-bedroom apartment in the basement of a 1920s rowhouse, with both private entrance and access to backyard. It has a comfortable bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and full-sized fridge, and a laundry room with washer and gas dryer. Located in a family-oriented but vibrant Brooklyn neighborhood, with plenty of stores and too many restaurants and bars to count. 3 blocks from a subway stop and 5 blocks from an express bus stop (20 min to Manhattan).", "name": "Newly renovated and cozy 1-bedroom in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/92fb9bf3-e3d5-4a07-9eb4-41f0ced3d184.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16798165", "id": "16798165", "price": 100, "review": "Mario's place is clean,beautiful and welly .
