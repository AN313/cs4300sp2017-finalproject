{"description": "Cute apartment with a killer location!  One bedroom with plenty of natural light.  Located in the heard of the west village, around the corner from Jefferson Market Garden, surrounded by the best restaurants and some of the most picturesque blocks in the city.  The apartment could not be better situated for visitors to the city, stay here and you'll be a regular at Jack's Coffee in no time!\n\nLocated in the center of several subway lines -- Less than two blocks away from the West 4th station (ACE lines) and the PATH station (New Jersey), and two blocks in the other direction will take you to Christopher St subway station (the 123).   Less than a 10 minute walk to the L / Union Square which is an easy shot over to Williamsburg.", "name": "West Village - 1 Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c49bff79-1fe1-4331-abae-f24a161cfe39.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16917171", "id": "16917171", "price": 135, "review": "As this is a new listing there were some obvious teething problems.  However Laura as a host is available communications wise and cooperative when it comes to making improvements.\n\nThe apartment is a fair size smaller than what we expected (largely due to some flattering angles in photos).  It is however in a brilliant location in the West Village.  Comes with all the basic necessities (bathroom, shower, iron, fridge, full size bed etc).  No TV (but the host notes this in the listing).  \n\nBedroom is located street facing.  So if you're a light sleeper I suggest ear plugs.\n\nThe place could use a once over cleaning wise before guests arrive (bathroom/shower wasn't clean, apartment was dusty).  The check in process needs work (we were not given the correct keys and had to stay in a hotel the first night, which was refunded by the host).  Aside from that if you're looking for a quaint home base to drop your things and rest your head whilst exploring the city, this is the spot."}
