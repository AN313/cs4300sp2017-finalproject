I'm so glad that I chose this one as the rest place while traveling to New York. It actually gives me the feeling of home. I really enjoy the stay. Less than 2mins to walk from the train stop and less than 20mins from the nearest transit center is convenient. The space quiet and clean and fit for single and couples. Highly recommended. "}
