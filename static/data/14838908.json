{"description": "The place is close to the Myrtle Broadway subway station, and traveling to the Manhattan and Williamsburg is extremely easy. The train is an express so there is only one stop before getting to the city.. You\u2019ll love the place because of the location and luxury building amenities. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, groups, and business travelers.\n\nLarge dining table. Washer and dryer in the unit. Deep-soak tub. The train going by the windows is really beautiful, and the sound is minimal with double pained windows, just a slight rumble you'll barely notice after being there for a day. Full gym in the basement as well as a balcony to enjoy morning coffee on. Dishwasher, and heat AC units in each room with remotes.\n\nThe gym on the first floor, as well as roof access.\n\nYou will be given the number of my host manager who will meet you to let you in and give you your keys. Other than that, you can contact me if there are any questions and I'll get right back to you.\n\nWilliamsburg/Bushwick/Bedstuy\n\nLittle Skips coffee is the best. Plenty of restaurants and bars. Lil Mo's. BK Bagels, Norberts Pizza, Roberta's.\n\nOne train stop to manhattan! Uber or cabs are also readily available.\n\nThere is no cat.", "name": "Brooklyn Trainhouse with Two Balconies", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9390caeb-2872-492e-9476-b984aee14aa7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14838908", "id": "14838908", "price": 150, "review": "Nice apartment. Good location. Kevin was great in communicating. Be sure you are okay with being by the train. The first night it bothered me. The second night I slept through it. If that doesn't bother you, this is a great place."}
