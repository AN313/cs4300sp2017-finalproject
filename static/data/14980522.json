Our studio is less than 2 minute walk to the F M J trains and 8 minute walk to the B D express station. You can get anywhere you want in the city while saving a lot of time on commute. There are also citibike stations, which are conveniently located around almost every corner. Supermarket and Laundry is right next door.", "name": "Cozy Lower East Side apt", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/179b76ac-c005-4b53-b440-44a8aae0891a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14980522", "id": "14980522", "price": 85, "review": "Great location with a lot of restaurants and bars nearby.
