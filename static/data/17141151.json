There is also a bus out side but I cannot say I know the route. the appt is a one bedroom with a couch (bed) in a well appointed bldg. An outside BBQ, game room, laundry room, and gym make this a good place to stay. Not much seating and a few basic dishes make it functional, but don't plan to host a dinner party. The property is very quiet and the neighbor hood is as well. "}
