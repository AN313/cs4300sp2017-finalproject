{"description": "Your perfect home away from home in NYC. A 5 minute walk to Central Park, Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. Steps away from NYC subways especially the 1, 2, A, B, C, and D. The Columbus Circle subway station is steps from the front door. Enjoy this quiet neighborhood conveniently located in the heart of Manhattan. Whole Foods, The Theater District, 5th Avenue shops, and the city's best restaurants are walking distance.", "name": "Brand New Central Park Condo NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/750e9196-f628-4625-93d6-b05232f22d2c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15309984", "id": "15309984", "price": 99, "review": "Me and my boyfriend had a lovely stay at Gill's studio. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is newly renovated. The place is close to a subway station as well as a lot of restaurants, shops and supermarkets. We definitely recommend the deli across the street for breakfast! Gill was always very reachable and kind. Overall, we had a great experience at Gill's place and we recommend it for solo travelers and couples strongly!"}
