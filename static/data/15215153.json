We had a very pleasant experience staying with Sam. The best thing I would say is Sam's responsiveness. He always responded to my texts and calls right away. He was very accommodating with the check-in/check-out process and exceeded our expectations of him. He went out of his way to provide us amenities that we didn't bring and was very helpful.\n\nThe apartment was very clean and comfortable for the five of us. It is located close to the subway station and very easy to get to Manhattan. We had a car and always found street parking nearby. There are groceries within walking distance and many restaurants that deliver. Brooklyn Museum, Prospect Park and Brooklyn Public Library is within walking distance. Overall a great location. The appliances, utensils, TV (Roku) were all very functional. The beds, sheets, towels were clean.\n\nI would strongly recommend to stay with Sam based on our experience."}
