{"description": "Super sunny and airy penthouse with walls of windows and tons of outdoor space.  A huge private deck, a shared roof and private balcony in large room all with amazing city views.  Our place is spacious and very comfortable, has nice energy with all the immense sunlight in every room.  Easy commute to the city and to Williamsburg, and within walking distance to amazing restaurants, cafes, bars and great boutiques.\n\nPrivate clean and comfortable guestroom has a queen sized bed for 2 with brand new mattress.  This room has it's own large balcony.  \nThere's also a small charming room upstairs that doesn't have an actual bed but a comfy full sized convertible sofa that can fit 2 people.  This small room has no door, but there is privacy.  It's a spiral stair case that leads to it with some frosty/blurry glass at top so you won't be able to see up from walking past the stairs at the bottom.  This small cozy room leads to another huge roof deck but this one is shared with other tenants (important to just stay in our section which is pretty large anyway).  Last but not least, our nice sized living area with open kitchen is parallel to our huge outdoor deck with super amazing city views as you see in photos.\n\nMy place is close to Lobster Joint, Eagle Trading Company, Bakeri, Eastern District, and Sweetleaf Coffee Roasters. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nGreenpoint avenue on the G train can be accessed from India Street which is closer \nB62 and B32 bus goes to Williamsburg and to Long Island City (more trains to the city)", "name": "Airy Penthouse w/lots of decks + views", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8ab9eb98-7109-4a74-b53f-78f8ab89742d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16488845", "id": "16488845", "price": 250}
