The neighborhood is amazing with tons of bars, pubs, caf\u00e9s, restaurants. \nThe apartment is on the 2nd floor and truely quiet since it's on the backyard.\nThe L station is really close to my apartment, like 1 minute by walk :) And a lot of busses. The G, M, J and Z trains are in 10 minutes by walk.\nPS : smoking in the apartment is not allowed.", "name": "Cosy apt in the heart of Williamsburg/Bedford", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1d98037a-aa5e-44b1-a273-da6e6998c5b0.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16027521", "id": "16027521", "price": 120, "review": "Sylvain's place was perfect and in an amazing location.
