{"description": "My place is close to Astoria Blvd Subway Stop. You\u2019ll love my place because of the people and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nSpacious 2 bedroom apartment in a great part of Astoria. Just a quick walk to the N/W train and you are in the heart of Manhattan in minutes. The apartment has a large kitchen with a dishwasher, two big bedrooms and an open living room with plenty of comfy seating. Many cool bars, restaurants and shops walking distance.\n\nRoommate will be available via phone, text, email and possibly able to stop by.\n\n5 minute walk to the N/W Astoria Blvd stop, 10 mins to 30th Ave or Ditmars and a 15 min walk to the M/R at Steinway street. The bus also stops at Astoria Blvd, and there is plenty of cabs and some street parking.\n\nGreat neighbors, laundry in the basement.", "name": "Spacious Two Bedroom- close to Subway", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8cdf83f6-8f76-4f72-a5c2-3a6615ac2e7c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16442423", "id": "16442423", "price": 110, "review": "This place was AMAZING!
