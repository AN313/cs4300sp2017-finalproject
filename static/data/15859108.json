{"description": "One of a kind, quiet, cozy and spacious Manhattan home, close to Columbia University and 30 seconds to the 123 Subway line. \n\nWe welcome you to the most convenient home in New York!\n\nRight by a grocery store and Starbucks, close to the M60SBS to LaGuardia Airport, in a quietest building. Perfect place to explore New York - just 10 mins from Times Square and 5 minutes walk from Central Park and the Hudson River.\n\nThere are separate rooms: separate bedroom, living room, bathroom, kitchen, and entrance foyer. BIGGER THAN A STUDIO! Don't pay $200 for a studio when you can pay less for our larger one bedroom apartment! \n\nWe also have a bathtub and a table for breakfast in bed, perfect for your most romantic day of the year :)\n\nYou will have access to the whole apartment, it is all yours!\n\nThe Upper West Side is the most exclusive and peaceful neighborhood in Manhattan. We have 24 hour convenience stores, many wine stores, a really good coffee shop, a 24 hour grocery store... Everything that New York is famous for, it is within 5 minutes of the apartment!\n\nEven though the map shows a certain location, we are actually right on the corner of 103rd Street and Broadway - literally 30 seconds walk to the 1 train, which takes you to Times Square in 12 minutes!!\n\n**The pricing you see is for three guests, the fourth guest can be accommodated but will have a case by case fee, because we have to get an extra bed**\n\nAnd, we have a piano! Feel free to play it :)", "name": "Perfect getaway in Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8b807778-928a-416a-b04c-368abe664742.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15859108", "id": "15859108", "price": 139, "review": "Great location at a great price.
