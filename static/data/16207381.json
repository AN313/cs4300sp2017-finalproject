{"description": "This light-filled 2 bedroom apt features floor to ceiling windows and an open floor plan. The apt is in a luxury building in East Harlem, walking distance to Central Park and easy subway access. Guests love the outdoor terrace (perfect for morning coffee) and spacious interior. The kitchen is fully equipped.\n\nTwo bedrooms (king and queen beds) and 2 full baths make this a roomy space for up to 4 people. Sorry, no closet space since this is my home but feel free to visit the gym and rooftop deck.", "name": "Airy 2-Bedroom Apt with Terrace in Spanish Harlem", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e5b9e89-73ac-407c-bec7-4d3161882be2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16207381", "id": "16207381", "price": 245}
