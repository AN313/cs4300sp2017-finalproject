{"description": "Beautiful, spacious apartment in the heart of Greenpoint.  Hardwood floors, high ceilings and lots of light. Right next to the G train stop, lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. \n\nLovely historic neighborhood with diverse culture and great architecture. Transmitter Park is at the end of the street; views of the East River and Manhattan. Also walking distance to McCarren Park, and Williamsburg.", "name": "Beautiful Greenpoint Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/34d20ccc-fe2a-4888-8220-b3ec41a3cbdf.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16360274", "id": "16360274", "price": 110, "review": "July was perfectly lovely and her room was clean and comfortable. Just be aware that this is not genuinely an entire place to yourself - it's a railroad with someone living between you and the kitchen/bath. If that turns you off, don't stay here. If you're down to hang with a goofy roommate, go for it! "}
