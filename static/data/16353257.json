The place is very clean and located next to many great shops and restaurants.  Due to considerable snow, the original plan for key pickup did not go as originally planned due to local businesses being closed.  The host, while away across the country, was able to get a key delivered to me via a driver when I arrived at the place.  Therefore, the host went out of her way to make sure I could get in and was not waiting out in the cold."}
