I really appreciated Arshad's communication skills, he was very helpful with any questions that came up while also being a hands off host. The place was so awesome, great location in Manhattan by the water/piers, High Rise with a great view and access to rooftop lounge! Very spacious Apt, close to many great food locations and the Time Square scene. If you like living like a boss I highly recommend this place!"}
