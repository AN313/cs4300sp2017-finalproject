{"description": "UPDATE  see \"the space\" Enjoy my fully furnished apartment in \"Ditmars\" Astoria. 30 min 2 Times Square. 5 Min walk 2 N and W subway line. We have the best greek restaurants on our corner and across the street. AC in the living room and ceiling fans in each bedroom. The 2nd bedroom has been converted into an office, so no door on that room but a \"murphy desk\" and a pop up trundle bed (2 singles). This apartment was fully renovated 1 year ago an it just feels like home from the moment you walk in.\n\n*******UPDATE as of April 1 I will have moved EVERYTHING out of the apartment aside from the bed and bed linens pictured as we are selling the place. HOWEVER, If all you need is a great place, location and brand new queen sized bed (all linens, towels, soap shampoo included) I will give you a deal! Just ask!!", "name": "Perfect sublet in Astoria 5 min WALK TO TRAIN!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/866b4065-5b1c-4ce9-822c-39a3c8b213cb.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17134130", "id": "17134130", "price": 75}
