{"description": "My place is right across the street from Prospect Park, and right around the corner of the Q subway 'Prospect Park' stop, which will bring you to Union Square within 20 minutes. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location and the safe,gentrifying, diverse neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe space is spacious, homy and clean. There is a  lot of light since there are two windows facing the street.\n\nYou will have complete access to the space.\n\nI am quick to respond via text during your stay, should you want advice on exploring the city.\n\nWe have across the street the beautiful Prospect Park, which is car-free, nicely quiet and more or less tourist-free compared to Central Park.\nThe neighborhood is safe and laid-back and has a couple of nice coffeeshops (tugboat tea company,Erv's), groceryshops (wholesome, OJ food-corp (open 24/7)) with ATM's and(cocktail)bars (midwood flats, Erv's) and I believe a bagel shop just opened up on Lincoln road. From Ocean avenue to Union square (14th street) it's about 20 minutes by subway and little over an hour by bike.\n\nThe apartment is right around the corner of the 'Prospect Park' subway stop, which serves the Q line (runs 24/7) the B line (doesn't run after midnight or weekends) and the Franklin avenue Shuttle (for connection to the blue line which runs to JFK airport). It will run all day and night, and will bring you to Union Square in 20 minutes.\n\nI'm very open and responsive to any questions.", "name": "Very conveniently located, clean Brooklyn studio!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1a33d046-6af3-45dd-82e7-611653a209f1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14682981", "id": "14682981", "price": 93, "review": "This apartment was a perfect space for my husband and I.  It was clean, comfortable, and very, very close to the metro line. We spent most of our time in Manhattan, but staying at this apartment in Brooklyn was totally fine.  We were happy to find a fair price with easy access to all the sites.  We would stay again and recommend it if you're willing to ride the metro around.  Also, the hosts had great communication. "}
