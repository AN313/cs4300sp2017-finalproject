{"description": "Hi! and welcome to my apartment. I'm an editor and filmmaker. When I not working on one of the new prime time shows in NY, I am gathering my own footage for my first feature film.   What I love most about this space is that it has a very open layout. The sun comes in and it has an amazing view. It really has all the essentials you would need while spending time in NY. I'm super close to all the trains and would love to have you in my space.\n\nThis apartment has all the essentials with an amazing view that lets in lots of light.\n\nYou have access to the full apartment.\n\nUsually, I will be away filming my documentary but I do hope that our paths will cross.\n\nThis amazing neighborhood is located next to everything.
