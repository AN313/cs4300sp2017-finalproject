{"description": "Cozy, Quiet 1BR in Chelsea located near within 3 blocks walk from 4 subway lines.  Apartment is furnished with a bed, couch, table, chairs, and internet.  \n\nI do have a clothes rack and hangars to use.  Unfortunately, I will lock the closet door as my clothes are there. \n\nI have a tea set, wine glasses, pots and pans, plates, knives, mixing bowls, bowls, and utensils.\n\nYou'll have access to my entire place.\n\nThis neighborhood is amazing!  It's extremely quiet, next to the West Village, Highline Park, Chelsea Market, and it's extremely easy to get around as there are 5 subway stops within two blocks of my apartment!", "name": "Cozy, 1 BR in Chelsea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/93fe8ca3-dc2c-4935-b4a0-efbfc0433612.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16601191", "id": "16601191", "price": 110, "review": "Chris's place was just as advertised and in a great neighbourhood for getting around the city. I was there for work and really valued being able to get out and about easily. The place is fairly minimal, but Chris was very explicit about that, and for me it was just fine. Although I didn't get to meet Chris, he was easy to reach and friendly about everything. "}
