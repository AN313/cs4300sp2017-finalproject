{"description": "Welcome to my Oasis in East Village. The apartment is located in the only dead end I know in NYC thus it's very quiet. With 4 windows facing South you will have tons of sunlight in the morning and during the day. This studio is for up to 4 people and I promise that everyone will sleep comfortably, as the daybed is easy convertible into a full size bed (actual full size mattress) and my loft bed above the kitchen. I love it and you will love it too. Very close to supermarkets and other cool spots\n\nLots of daylight and super quiet. A real escape in the city.\n\nEast Village is the neighborhood with lots of great and diverse restaurants and bars for the real New York experience.", "name": "Green Oasis in East Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b912faca-8563-47ee-bc34-8201260cc0be.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16403353", "id": "16403353", "price": 110, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival.
