He replied super quickly all of the time, was very informative about the area and was SUPER accommodating when we had issues getting there in time to check-in. We would definitely stay again. The two TVs were a definite plus and he also has a ton of DVDs. There was a lot to do in the area; We went to Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant which was only a $5.73 Uber ride away."}
