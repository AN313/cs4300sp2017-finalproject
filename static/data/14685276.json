{"description": "My loft apartment is available for visitors to NYC (business or pleasure). It is a light filled open space with 12 foot/3.60m high ceilings. My place is close to Fort Greene Park, Pratt Institute, and all the lovely cafes and restaurants of Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Bedford-Stuyvesant. Whether you are a couple traveling overseas, solo adventurers, in new york on business, or a family (with kids), you will be happy in my place!\n\nA gorgeous and amazing open space just like what you should experience in a Brooklyn old factory apartment converted.\n\nThe apartment is a 5 minute walking distance to subway and extremely convenient with restaurantes and grocery stores.", "name": "gorgeous loft!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cfaabb96-7f62-4319-89b5-4cdee6c2c8eb.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14685276", "id": "14685276", "price": 95, "review": "Easy communication, nice size space"}
