{"description": "My place is located on the border of Downtown Brooklyn and neighborhood of Dumbo. It is a 10 mins walk to Brooklyn Bridge where you can enjoy the best view to Manhattan. It's close to two subway stations (Dekalb Ave & J Street-Metrotech) which mean that with a 5-7 minute walk you can access 6 lines (A,C,F,B,Q,R). It is super close to Manhattan and very convenient for those who hated long commutes of New York Subway.\n\nMy place has a double loft bed(shown in the picture) and a sofa, which can become a double bed. There is also another couch which can be opened and become bed for two people. There are a lot of options for sleeping (lol).\nYou can also use my small dining table and my desk. \nThe kitchen is shared with another studio but I have my own cabinets and dishes etc.\n\nYou will have access to the studio, bathroom and half of the shared kitchen. There is also a washer and a dryer in the basement.\n\nThe most important fact about this apartment is its location. It is super convenient to get to every corner of the city from this location. Guests will not suffer long waiting and irregular schedules of NYC subway. It is a mess! believe me.", "name": "Studio close to Brooklyn Bridge", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ae8aaf70-e452-443c-9e1e-3901b8df1955.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15941716", "id": "15941716", "price": 65, "review": "I enjoyed staying at this apartment! It's really cozy and you have the choice been sleeping on the couch or on the loft bed. The shower can be tricky by there's some helpful instructions on how to get it right. It's not too far from the subway, and it's very close to the Manhattan Bridge, which I walked across for work while I was here. Communication with the host was pleasant and they were incredibly helpful!"}
