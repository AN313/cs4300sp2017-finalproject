{"description": "Fist time trying airbnb. Girlfriend and I are off to Asia for 5 weeks. Renting out my space will offset vacation expenses.\nVery close to Lincoln Center/ \nCentral Park/Columbus Circle. You\u2019ll love my place because of super convenient location, entire apartment is yours, the building has a very relaxed vibe. This is a well maintained pre-war building with elevator. Very close to central park, Lincoln center and a wide variety of restaurants and local bars in the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen.", "name": "Studio apt in Midtown Manhattan, great value", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4f2d590e-1bf8-4b0c-a144-338376ea89a1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16301464", "id": "16301464", "price": 97, "review": "Had a lot of trouble checking it due to the previous tenant, he told me he made a deal with the assistant or Don that he would be staying in the studio till 8pm when my check in time was 3pm but we managed to work something out due to the fact I was solely staying in the studio to sleep and shower after touring. the prev tenant also left the bed and bathroom a mess, I'm assuming no one went in after him to pick up because the sheets where covered in white stuff so I slept on top of his comforter. The bathroom had trash all over the floor and i couldn't find one clean towel in the closet provided, they either smelled bad or had several stains which I didn't want to mess with. I'm giving Don's place a two star because of the amazing location( across from a Starbucks, down the street from Paris baguette and the Blue line) and his assistant was able to respond to me fairly quickly when I was having trouble with the tenant, the key, and his front door.
