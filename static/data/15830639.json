{"description": "*This apartment comes with an adorable, cuddly cat named Monroe.  That said, you must prove to be animal loving, responsible folk.  \nYou\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the coziness, and the high ceilings. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers (if you have time for feeding and showing some affection to Monroe).  The kitchen is stocked for one who enjoys to cook, but the area has many great restaurants to try.\n\nThis is an absolutely NON-SMOKING home.  Not even out a window and definitely not in front of the house.\n\nMake yourself at home here and live like a New Yorker (a really respectful one).\n\n3 Blocks walk from Historic Fort Greene Park.  Check out off leash every morning before 9am for a spectacle and to get some canine love.  \nFort Greene is a beautifully diverse neighborhood with beautiful architecture at every turn.  5 minute walk from the Brooklyn Flea (in summer) and 10 minutes walk to the indoor location in winter.\n\nClose to a B-38 bus stop, Uber is always a call away, green taxis are easy to catch, walking distance to many subway lines: G, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, B, Q, R, A, C.\n\nThis is an absolutely NON-SMOKING home.  Not even out a window and definitely not in front of the house.", "name": "Brownstone Charm", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/34bafcaa-8ee8-4486-a007-bf0128e00620.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15830639", "id": "15830639", "price": 95, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival.
