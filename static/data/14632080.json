You\u2019ll love my place because it's located right on the boarder of Lower East Side and Chinatown, the coolest hood in Manhattan! My studio has amazing light, park view, Cali vibes in NYC. The bed is super cozy. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. XO\n\nI LOVE my studio. It's as open and spacious for its size. Modern warmth with light and love.
