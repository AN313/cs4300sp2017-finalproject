{"description": "My place is close to Employees Only, Joseph Leonard, Rosemary's, Fat Cat, Smalls Jazz Club, Union Square, Stonewall Inn, Hudson River, Chelsea Piers, Highline. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location, the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).\n\nConveniently located in the heart of the West Village. A stones-throw away from historic Christpother St., and a quick 5-10 minute walk to landmarks in Chelsea and SoHo. Great shopping and restaurants are all just around the corner.\n\nOpen access to the entire apartment.\n\nWill be available to offer tips on the neighborhood/city, but will mostly be out of your hair.\n\nIt's the West Village. It doesn't get much better than this.\n\nClose to subways- A,B,C,D,E,F,M & 1 \nClose to the best restaurants and shops, also convenient Citi Bike stations.", "name": "West Village Apt in the Heart of the Action", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/81d6d865-fc92-4321-891b-72fcefac5a1d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14239259", "id": "14239259", "price": 200}
