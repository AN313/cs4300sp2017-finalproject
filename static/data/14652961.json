The apartment is in a very nice location for Washington Heights, close grocery stores and restaurants and the 168th st subway stop. The inside of the apartment was very, very spacious and clean with all the essentials, and Nelly offered to provide extra when we asked. Unfortunately the TV was not working when we were there but that was not a big problem. I highly recommend staying at Nelly's apartment. "}
