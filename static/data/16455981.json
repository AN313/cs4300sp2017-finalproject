{"description": "Close to the  Lorimer L stop and the  JMZ trains. 10 min to the city by car or train. Parking is easy. You\u2019ll love my place because of the room, neighborhood, fire escape, closet space and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe tall ceilings\n\nThe whole apartment except for my bedroom\n\nThe neighborhood had some really nice restaurants, bars and venues in the area.\n\nIt's easy to get to the L,J,M,Z, trains. And the Williamsburg bridge is about 5 min away by car.\n\nBrand new queen size bed", "name": "Cozy apt  in Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dcb528e1-daa5-46f6-93fe-7dc22a12e51c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16455981", "id": "16455981", "price": 120, "review": "We stayed at Avi's apartment for a few days in March, and found it a great base from which to explore NYC.\n\nIt's pretty basic, but has everything you'd need and isn't far from subway stations.\n\nThe wifi is a little bit intermittent and unreliable (working only in one corner of the apartment).\n\nAvi was out of town so we didn't meet him, but check-in/check-out was very easy, and we could make contact with his neighbour if we needed anything. Avi was always prompt and helpful responding to messages."}
