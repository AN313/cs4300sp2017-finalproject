{"description": "The apartment is in a great neighborhood in lower-midtown Manhattan, within walking distance of Herald Square, the Empire State Building, nightlife, etc. You can actually see the Empire State building from the street corner :-p\n\nThe subway is a 5 - 10 minute walk away. There's tons of restaurants in the area, grocery stores such as Fairway and Trader Joe's within a 5 minute walk, a pharmacy (Rite Aid), even a laundromat and a hardware store!\n\nAnything else you'd like to know, feel free to ask!\n\nThe nearest subway is the 6 train that's about 5 - 10 minutes away. You can also use the buses along 2nd Ave to get around, and of course walk to just about anywhere in the city!", "name": "Full 1 bedroom apt in an awesome area!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bbe2f817-008d-45ca-ad9a-0d1b3ea6d54e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16396507", "id": "16396507", "price": 120, "review": "Verun we great and so was the apartment.
