{"description": "Sunny, cosy East Village studio with private bathroom and kitchen, Air Conditioning and roof access. Close to amazing restaurants, parks, bars, and awesome shopping. It's a 2 minute walk to the L-Train Subway, a 10 minute walk to Union square and a 10 minute subway ride to Williamsburg. Central location walking distance from Soho, the Lower East Side and loads of other cool spots. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers and pets.", "name": "Sunny, Quiet East Village Studio in Great Locaiton", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1a6db227-ef56-412c-a9e8-69b7466b68f9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14821118", "id": "14821118", "price": 150, "review": "Location was perfect for us in the East Village!
