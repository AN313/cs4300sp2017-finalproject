{"description": "Hi there, my place is 3 minutes walk to express Q/B train (30 min to Union Square) and also 3 mins walk to beautiful Prospect Park. Restaurants, cafes and laudrymat are few seconds away. Quiet, high celling and only one floor up.  My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe entire apartment\n\nI'm usually not around because I rent my place only when I'm traveling. That is why my place is self-checkin (keypad). But I have friends around if ever there's a emergency.\n\nI don't have a parking spot so you either park on the street which I think is relatively easy to find in day time and there's also a parking garage across the street on Flatbush called Jenuwen that you can look into.", "name": "The Brooklyn Vibe", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/97c134e2-dbac-42a4-b2b3-45cc78ba92dd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14266097", "id": "14266097", "price": 120, "review": "Fantastic.
