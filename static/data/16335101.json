{"description": "One bedroom Apt with cool city feeling. Fits for 2 and can comfortably accommodate up to 4guests. It's good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families with kids. The bedroom has a queen size bed, the living room has a couch, double single beds plus there are blow-up beds and mobile crib if needed. A nice cozy eat-in kitchen. Laundromat around the corner, many shops, cafes, restaurants, grocery stores and food co-op near by. Close to Prospect Park and two subway stations.\n\nWhat we love about our neighborhood is that it is in the proximity of Prospect Park. Can walk to the Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Museum. There is a foods cooperative near by and a shopping center including Sears and other many NYC boutiques that are great for finding souvenirs and gifts.\n\nOur neighbor is south of Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanic Garden and walking distance to Kings Theater. There are cute cafes and restaurants around. There are plenty of transit options to choose from. Two nearby subway stations, the famous \"$Vans\"  lines and a few different bus stops depending on where one would like to go.", "name": "Brooklyn Style Apartment!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b5881bb9-d50e-479b-8126-bfaaef24e5c1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16335101", "id": "16335101", "price": 95, "review": "We really enjoyed our stay! Thanks to Sandra and Orlando for the great place, the apartment had everything we needed and we felt comfortable too! The area was local and there were subway transits to and from the city which was very convenient. Thanks again Sandra and Orlando! :)"}
