The apartment was huge, comfy, and pretty much perfect for our needs! (I think a microwave was the only thing I kind of wished for, but I think I'm just lazy... they're quite bad for you anyway and it was easy to make do without it!) There are tons of shops nearby for groceries, the subway is close, and we were able to park right in front of the apartment for free. I'd absolutely stay here again in the future."}
