The apartment is nice, we were allowed to use the garden, the location is great when it comes to public transportation and, in general, staying here in Brooklyn was fantastic.\r\nWe had two small issues - just small things that happened - that were resolved promptly. Would definitely recommend.\r\nBeing able to cook a small meal is nice when you don't want to go out all the time."}
