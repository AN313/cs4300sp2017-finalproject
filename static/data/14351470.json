{"description": "Beautiful studio located in the heart of Manhattan,  between Times Square, Central Park and Columbus Circle- home to many coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Also close Gotham West Market, Port Authority and West Riverside. Subway station is less than 5 minutes walk! Good for couples, solo adventurers and business travelers.\n\nYou should have unlimited access to the apartment. All cooking utensils, dishes, glasses, etc. are open to your use.\n\nIt's easy to get in touch with me by phone call, text or email anytime. I am flexible with check-in and check-out times. Please email me before booking if you have a specific time that you need and we will work it out.  Any questions about getting around the city, places to go or about apartment use you may have.  Feel free to ask me anything!\n\nThe building is located in Midtown West, near Times Square, on West 49th street.\nGreat central location, with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. It's what it is mostly known for. That and the convenience to just about everything in Manhattan, and you'll never be too far from anything!\nIn the heart of the Broadway Theater District, Hell's Kitchen, very close to Times Square (8 minutes walk), and not far from Central Park.\n\nThe C and E trains are located at 8th Avenue and 50th street, so pretty close. If you trek a bit farther to Times Square at Broadway and 42nd Street, you will find every bit of public transportation you should need.", "name": "Charming Hell's Kitchen Studio near Times Square", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9d2d09e1-bb6d-4a92-8a8d-00c2074ff45e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14351470", "id": "14351470", "price": 206, "review": "Great location, easy access to subways, and super comfy beds!!"}
