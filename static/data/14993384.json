{"description": "My place is in the southeast part of Williamsburg. \n\nIt is spacious and minimal, yet cozy and has all the essentials. \n\nIt has easy access to major transportation routes -- the subway entrance is on the same block. (J, M, Z trains)\n\nIn addition to being walking distance to all the highlights of Williamsburg, the apartment is located on the same block as many convenient stores including a grocery store, laundromat, dollar store, fancy wine store, and several deli/corner markets.", "name": "Williamsburg Studio Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5bd1a64c-16cd-426c-92e2-c2b9ee143df9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14993384", "id": "14993384", "price": 107, "review": "Great location and great value! My husband and I stayed here for two nights over New Year's and were very pleased with our stay. Sami wasn't able to meet us but her friend did instead and our check in and check out went great. Wifi was strong. The location is very conveniently located next to the subway. We didn't have any issues with the train noise but we're used to living in a city. Great economical place to stay in the city. Be sure you note that the bed is a twin size. There is a also a twin size air mattress so two people can have a place to sleep. "}
