{"description": "Enjoy ENTIRE APT from 4/10 - 4/18 (We return on the 18th) If you need longer time by a day or two let us know. You would have the entire lovely apartment to yourself! We are 3 blocks from the subway; 20 minute subway ride from Times Square!  This is a great apt. and an amazing deal!\n\nOur little cat and bird will be there. All we ask is for you to make sure the bird has water, and maybe sift the litter once. Other than that they have automatic feeders, so you don't need to worry about anything!\n\nOur apartment is awesome, lovely, beautifully decorated. You'll have a great time. Get on over!\n\nYou can use the entire apartment, the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, just don't go digging through our belongings. We will have all the drawers and spaces for your use specially and clearly marked.\n\nThere are a ton of restaurants nearby, plus grocery stores, and drug stores. \n\nWe are also three blocks away from Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital if you fancy those interns with all of their Grey's Anatomy drama. \n\nAlso, hop on the M4 bus, which is one block away, and go see the beautiful Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park! Definitely worth a visit.\n\nWe live three blocks away from the 1, A, and C train subway station! We are a 20 minute subway ride from Times Square, a 25 minute train ride from Macy's, oh, we are so close to everything Manhattan has to offer! \n\nAlso, if you would like to go to the world famous Bronx Zoo, it's a fairly easy commute as well.\n\nOur cat and parakeet will be there. They have automatic feeders. All we ask is that you give the bird water and maybe sift the litter box once. Other than that just enjoy the place. Our pets just mind their own business.", "name": "ENTIRE ONE BEDROOM APT!!
