Le logement \u00e9tait confortable et propre. La station de m\u00e9tro qui vous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 Manhattan est \u00e0 seulement trois minutes de marche, ce qui est g\u00e9nial! Pour le c\u00f4t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatif, la chambre principale donne sur une rue tr\u00e8s bruyante et l'appartement n'est pas tr\u00e8s isol\u00e9 par rapport au voisins. Je vous conseille de vous apporter des bouchons."}
