{"description": "Very peaceful space in the heart of the most fun neighborhood in the city. Two big windows let lots of light into the living space. Plenty of empty shelving in the bedroom area for you to unpack and spread out your things. Updated and fully stocked kitchen if you like to prepare food at home. Beautiful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle down below on the streets!\n\nLockbox with keys\n\nThe neighborhood is very New York with a bit of a 90s vibe. Comfortable rooftop and backyard. The apartment is close to Tompkins Square Park, comedy clubs, seemingly infinite bars and restaurants, delis, and music venues.\n\nThe nearby F train will take you through the middle of Manhattan to Rockefeller Center/Central Park, or the nearby L train goes to trendy Williamsburg. Nice walk to Chinatown, Little Italy, Soho, Flatiron, or Greenwich Village.", "name": "Cozy sunny Alcove 1-bedroom- Rooftop with a view!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4d2eaf20-0cfb-4f43-b0c5-8b69aa836648.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14437093", "id": "14437093", "price": 129, "review": "Great host!
