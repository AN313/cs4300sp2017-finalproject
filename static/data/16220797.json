{"description": "My place is blocks away from the Guggenheim, Metropolitan Museum, Smithsonian, Central Park, Whole Foods, Duane Reade, and the Subway 4, 5, 6 & Q (Green & Yellow), which takes you to all the major sights. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, nice restaurants and bars, new kitchen and bath, and overall cleanliness. My place is good for solo adventurers and business travelers.", "name": "Designer's Studio in Upper East", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/92bff6eb-5bbf-4c09-9c75-6bba32f0e00d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16220797", "id": "16220797", "price": 50}
