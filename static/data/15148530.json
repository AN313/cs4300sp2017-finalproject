El vecindario es muy lindo, la gente s\u00faper simp\u00e1tica. La casa es m\u00e1s grande de lo que parece. Est\u00e1 muy cerca del subway que te lleva a Manhattan y podes combinar con un mont\u00f3n de l\u00edneas. La atenci\u00f3n fue muy buena, ante cualquier inconveniente nos comunic\u00e1bamos con Ashley y ella lo solucionaba. Recomiendo!"}
