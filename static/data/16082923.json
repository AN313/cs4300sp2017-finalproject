{"description": "My home is very quiet and cozy with amazing natural light. It is a great getaway for 1 person, 2 people, a couple, or even 2 couples. \nIt's 2 blocks to the beach, 1 block to the grocery store, and very close to the Beach 67th st. subway stop off the A train. Parking is very easy right in front too. Rockaway Brewery and Goody's Caribbean food (a locals fav) is 1 block away. The surf breaks by me are some of the best in the hood. Several surf schools set up at my beach too, if you want to learn!\n\nI spent over a year picking out every detail that went into rebuilding this bungalow. The skylights and pitched ceiling create an open and airy feeling. Draw the curtains and enjoy privacy or let the sun radiate in. You will be transported to a cabin deep in the woods in the bedroom.
