Our home is newly renovated with the private guest apartment on the top floor.

Bushwick is known for its many artists and musicians who newly reside here, and the Puerto Rican and Dominican families who have been here for many years. This mix makes for great food and arts and is  very family friendly. We are a young family with a small child and love living here.\n\nSubway \u2014 The Central Avenue \"M Train\" subway station is a 2 minute walk from our apartment, located on the other end of our block. The NYC subway system is interconnected, allowing passengers to go anywhere the trains go. You can purchase a pre-paid \"Metro Card\" at the subway station. If you plan on using the subway alot during your stay we recommend buying an \"unlimited\" Metro Card that allows you to use it as much as you want over a duration of time. Unfortunately, you can not use the same unlimited pass for multiple people.\n\nThe Central Ave \"M\" subway station is a 15 min train ride into the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\n\nWe are also a short walk to the \"L\" subway line that takes passengers through popular Williamsburg Brooklyn before heading into Manhattan's Union Square and Meat Packing District.\n\nFor car service, we recommend Uber or Lyft, but will also supply a list of local livery companies that will come pick you up.\n\nParking \u2014\u00a0If you plan on driving, there is FREE street parking on the streets around the neighborhood. There are \"alternate side\" parking rules that apply on some mornings (Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri), so expect to move you car to avoid getting a ticket.\n\nAirports \u2014 We recommend flying into either JFK or La Guardia because they are both closest to the apartment. Both airports offer public transportation (subway train or taxi). Of the two, JFK is the preferred commute because it's more direct to the house. Note: Newark Airport is in New Jersey, and although possible, it is a very long journey to get to our apartment in Brooklyn.\n\nWe offer a set of clean linens, hair dryer, bath towels and basic toiletries upon your arrival. In the kitchen you will find coffee and creamers for the morning and basic condiments to add to any meal (cooked or ordered in). \n\n\n4 guests or less: There are two queen size beds for your use.\n5 and 6 guests: We will provide an additional blanket, set of sheets and 2 pillows for use with the sofa bed.\n\nWe provide a handbook that has an assortment of recommended restaurants, bars and other tidbits that will help guide you around the neighborhood.\n\nGrocery Shopping \u2014 There is a grocery store very conveniently located at both of the nearby local and express subway train stops!
