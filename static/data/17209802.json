{"description": "My place is two blocks from The Brooklyn Bridge Promenade and Park, walking distance to great coffee shops, cafes, and wine bars, one block to the major subway lines, and only several stops to/from Manhattan. You\u2019ll love the location of my apartment in charming tree lined Brooklyn Heights and the warm ambiance of antiques, reclaimed/distressed furniture, antique rugs, and original art. My place is great for couples and solo adventurers.", "name": "Cozy ambiance in Brooklyn Heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cb660696-8d2b-4880-8e57-5fa2399b9e7d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17209802", "id": "17209802", "price": 150, "review": "Great spot...
