{"description": "Well decorated, tidy, quiet studio on a beautiful tree-lined street one block from Prospect Park and minutes from the F, G, B, Q, 2, and 3 trains. Less than 20 minutes to Manhattan. Park Slope is a great neighborhood with many coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc and easy access to JFK and LGA. The apartment is very comfortable and the price is really good for the area. There is a kitchenette with coffee making supplies, pots, pans, etc. Newly renovated bathroom, full size bed, and a nice view.\n\nI'm always available by phone, text, or email before and during your visit to answer questions about the space, the city, or anything else you need.", "name": "Bright Park Slope Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/04d30f4e-bed9-4630-8d93-65ad02c9a830.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15192482", "id": "15192482", "price": 140, "review": "The space is light and airy.
