{"description": "Proximity to Prospect Park and the subway can't be beat! Spacious light filled loft-like feel. Great for a couple or solo traveler.\n**This is a minimum 1-month booking. I have flexibility with the start date but cannot rent for shorter than 30 days, sorry!  If you have needs outside of these dates or for a shorter duration I have a separate listing of this room as a share of my 2 bedroom flat--I home share and live here full time but travel periodically.", "name": "Parkside Penthouse", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35471d22-0b99-42eb-b376-a87c3aa1eb04.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14564673", "id": "14564673", "price": 90, "review": "I had an amazing stay @ Jen's apartment... First of all, Jen is a really nice person and communication was excellent. Even with a 3 hours delay, my arrival was easy. The apartment is awesome, perfectly located to explore NYC and very well equiped. Everything was clean and perfectly functional. I was surprised by the size of the bedroom, bigger than expected and the bed was comfy.\nThe only  thing to know is that it is bit noisy, but it is more related to NYC than the apartment and we get use to it very quickly."}
