The apartment was very quiet and clean. Plenty of space for two people- more spacious than a hotel room as well. Milan was very accommodating, he met us outside of the apartment and even helped us find street parking. Milan was a pleasure to work with and I would recommend his apartment to anyone thinking of going to the city."}
