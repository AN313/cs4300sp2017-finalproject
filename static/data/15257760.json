Public transit in any direction around NYC is walkable from this apartment too which made our trip very convenient. Zach himself is also a wonderful (super)host. He is easy to communicate with and friendly, and provided a very clean and accommodating apartment. We had three adults in our group and we were all comfortable in the space. I will definitely be looking this listing up again the next time I am visiting Manhattan. "}
