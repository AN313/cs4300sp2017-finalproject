Our studio is less than 2 minute walk to the F,M,J,Z trains and only 8 minute walk to the B D express station. You can get anywhere you want in the city while saving a lot of time on commute. There are also citibike stations, which are conveniently located around almost every corner. Supermarket and Laundry is right next door.", "name": "Cozy Private apartment in LES Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6b000a2f-5fb1-4dcd-bcab-8de5f7937906.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16645254", "id": "16645254", "price": 82, "review": "Ryan's place is very clean and looks just like the pictures. The apartment is small and would not be good if you were planning on spending a lot of time there or cooking a lot, but it was perfect for what I needed and in a great location. There are a number of good restaurants and bars nearby, and I would stay there again. Thanks Ryan!"}
