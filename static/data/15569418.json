My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets). The beautiful exposed brick wall is inviting and makes you feel the New York vibe. Hope you like it as much as I do. ENJOY!!\n\nYou will have access to the whole apartment\n\nMy Apartment is close to all major subway lines to 14th street\n1,2,3 trains(just around the corner)\nF,M train(one avenue away)\nA,C,E,L trains(one avenue away)\nand all other remaining subway lines are about a 5-6 minute walk to Union Square.\n\nIts an old railroad apartment building, so the radiator sometimes makes a bit of a sound while heating up. \nIf you are going to be doing some cooking, please let me know if you need other type of cooking utensils.
