It is small but everything is new and clean and you have all the staff that you need.  The kitchen is really good equiped and you have blankets, pillows, towells.. All new! \nAsaf was really nice with us and provide us all the things that we need and the comunication with him was excellent every single moment. \nJust as a negative point that is a basement and you can hear some noises   upstairs. \nYou can go walking to the subway station (10 minutes)  and take the line F to arrive   Manhattan in 30 minutes.  The neighborhood is quite and safe and you have a supermarket so close.  We were so glad for choose this place and we recommended for everybody"}
