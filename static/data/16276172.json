{"description": "This  is close to Halsey Subway Station. You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance and the outdoors space. My place is great for couples, groups of friends (BYO air mattress), solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nThe space is a full sized apartment that has access to a fantastic backyard with a grill.\n\nOne bedroom with a queen sized bed and a large couch meaning three can sleep comfortably in this space. There is also enough floor space for two full sized air mattresses (one in the living room and another in the bedroom). [Air mattresses are not included.]\n\nGuests will be given a code to the front door in order to access the apartment - meaning check-in time is extremely flexible. Need to get into the space sooner? Write in and if possible, you'll be able to arrive earlier than the typical check in time.\n\n* Your entrance is private and will only be in use by you.\n\nThe space is being managed by someone living very close and so help can be available quickly.\n\nThe Broadway area has pretty much anything to meet your needs.\n\nJust four blocks way from the J line - this apartment is easy to get to from JFK/LIRR and just 30 minutes from downtown Manhattan.\n\nThere is a supermarket and large pharmacy nearby for anything you may need as well as a variety of different take out restaurants.\n\nThis is a basement apartment.", "name": "Newly Renovated with Lovely Backyard!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a49f6ba2-d8fc-4fd4-b740-35bd45ab1365.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16276172", "id": "16276172", "price": 55, "review": "Convenient to the subway - found a great parking spot.
