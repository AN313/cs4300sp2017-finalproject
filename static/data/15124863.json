Nous avons eu la chance de la rencontrer \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e afin d'avoir des d\u00e9tails sur le quartier (m\u00e9tro, restaurants...). L'appartement \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s propre et il y a avait tout ce dont nous avions besoin. \u00c0 quelques blocs, il y a un grand supermarch\u00e9 pour faire ses courses ce qui est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.
