He was very accommodating with our 1:30am check-in time and gave us a brief rundown of the amenities and the area. The place looked exactly like the pictures and was clean. We had our own privacy and didn't see any other guests/residents when entering/exiting the basement apartment. The shower was a bit small but there was always hot water! It was also nice to be able to control the temperature. It's in a lovely area with lots of street parking and within walking distance of some small stores (including a pharmacy and grocery store) and the LIRR.  Would definitely stay here again!"}
