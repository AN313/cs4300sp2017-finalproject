{"description": "Our clean and spacious 2 bedroom apartment is a short walk to Rockaway Beach Surf Club, Tacoway Beach, Playland Motel and Ripper's. We have 2 bedrooms with a double bed in each, and huge couch that can comfortably be used as a single bed for a 5th person (extra charge).\nThe best part of all, it's just a block away to the beach, with the surf break at 90th st. Bonus: we've got a nice longboard you can borrow during your stay. Double bonus: the kitchen opens up to a big backyard garden.", "name": "Rockaway Beach Surf and Garden Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dae2734e-fc91-445f-ae8b-32d607019d78.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14220422", "id": "14220422", "price": 125, "review": "Great & cozy place to stay, so close to the wonderful beach & everything.
