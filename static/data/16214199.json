{"description": "My parent's wonderful home is located in East Elmhurst, NY. It's in a very calm neighborhood a block away from the bus stop and a shopping center. You can get to Times Square thru public transportation in less than an hour with relative ease. LaGuardia airport is 5 minutes away and JFK airport is 20-30 minutes away. You have access to major highways and you are only 15 minutes away from Brooklyn, Bronx, and Manhattan making it a great place to stay while visiting.", "name": "Peaceful 3BR house in the heart of Queens", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a8b8e16d-3878-4d57-93d2-41b9d5e962ab.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16214199", "id": "16214199", "price": 180, "review": "David's listing worked out well for our party of four adults and one child. The location was great for us since we were in the city to attend family functions in Queens. The house is  close to LaGuardia airport and major roadways yet the neighborhood is very quiet. There is a shopping center nearby with great bakery, grocery store, etc. and having off street parking was a plus. We did not meet David but he was very prompt and helpful with his communication and the sister who greeted us was very welcoming."}
