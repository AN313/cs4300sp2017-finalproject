{"description": "Large, modern, newly renovated apartment in a quiet area of Astoria. Minutes from the historical Astoria Park, short walk to the N/Q @ 30th ave subway stop. 10 minute subway ride to midtown Manhattan. Great restaurants and coffee shops in close proximity. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, and the beautiful roof deck with nice view. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nUpper deck view of manhattan\n\nAll the time, anytime ..", "name": "Home in Astoria", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3b74d61d-7f0c-4573-bad2-308e3e29ef0f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15484896", "id": "15484896", "price": 108, "review": "Rami's apartment is perfect! It is super comfortable and has everything you need. The location is safe and convenient  and the building has a sweet rooftop deck with a great view of the city. Rami was an excellent host who was attentive, responsive, and flexible. We will definitely check his place out next time we're in the city. Thanks, Rami!"}
