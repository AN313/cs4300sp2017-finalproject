She answered all of my questions and has a great friend that patiently checks you in. The apartment is in a fantastic location, right in the center of all everything, I didn't have a car and I didn't need one, I was able to enjoy the area as I walked around. Safe environment, super clean apartment, very cozy. It was overall an awesome stay. I would recommend this apartment to anyone!"}
