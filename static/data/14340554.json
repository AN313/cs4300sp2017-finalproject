Despite the fact that it was pretty noisy (due to all the residential development in the area) we slept well as the loft apartment was cosy and warm with everything we needed. Not far from the train over the Williamsburg bridge. Enjoyed walking over it into Manhattan and back over the Brooklyn Bridge. A good walk! Communication for keys/access was great. Loved the views from the rooftop at night. Thanks Lorena for everything. "}
