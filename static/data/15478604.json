{"description": "My place is close to a number of new restaurants opening up. Chimu Peruvian Chicken is FANTASTIC. Bushwick's Roberta's is a ten minute walk away. There are two subway lines within 3 blocks. \nThis is my parents' guest suite when they come visit. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThis is a spacious guest apartment. My parents will stay here when they visit us. I've had the whole space redone. All the furniture is new, everything.\n\nI am happy to provide information and tips, but guests should expect to have peace and quiet.\n\nGreat South American Food, as well as a growing number of artisanal vendors of all kinds. Bushwick studios are a quick walk away.\n\nWe have two subways each 5 minutes away.", "name": "Guest suite in owner-occupied private residence", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/940d2c40-23c1-4a5a-8e2a-f65673953622.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15478604", "id": "15478604", "price": 70, "review": "Martins place was perfect.
