{"description": "The apartment is bright and clean, with a spacious open floor plan and a full sized fold out couch in the living room. There are two bedrooms and one bathroom. The 6 train is on our corner- It is a convenient 15 min. ride to Grand central. The 2,3 is a seven minute walk away. Central park is nearby, as is Museum Mile. The area is vibrant and there are really amazing places to eat in the often overlooked neighborhood.", "name": "Bright and Sunny 2 Bedroom Apt.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c7c01704-5414-40d5-9632-d0d36de9510b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15632312", "id": "15632312", "price": 170}
