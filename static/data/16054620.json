{"description": "5 min walk to grocery market, laundromat and busy Pitkin Ave where you can find anything you may need. 30 mins of subway to Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park. 40 mins of subway to Manhattan. 1 hour of subway to JFK. You\u2019ll love my place because of 15 min walk or bus to many subway stops ( local C and express A, 4, 3). Quiet neighborhood for NYC. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nPlease feel free to contact me for any questions you may have", "name": "An Entire Spacious 1BR Apt Just For You", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/25295b56-5e4c-4c96-98b1-5b1c4f98ec04.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16054620", "id": "16054620", "price": 56, "review": "No frills but adequate for a short stay."}
