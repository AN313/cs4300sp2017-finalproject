She showed us the place and gave us the keys.  It was nice she was still in New York for her to make another key when the key got jammed in a wrong lock.  She replied quickly and told us specifics and what to expect before arrival and what to do after.  The location was good with restaurants, cleaners, and shops on the block.  It was a nice pretty spacious place close to the subway and within walking distance to the city.  The apartment was also super warm in the winter didn't even need the heat."}
