{"description": "Located in the heart of the lower east side, you're surrounded by many great restaurants, nightlife and entertainment venues. Our studio is less than 2 minute walk to the F,M,J,Z trains and only 8 minute walk to the B, D express station. You can get anywhere you want in the city while saving a lot of time on commute. There are also citibike stations, which are conveniently located around almost every corner. Supermarket and Laundry is right next door.", "name": "Cozy & Spacious Private apartment in LES", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dae607ab-6a80-4984-a39e-df16a5e6252a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15452495", "id": "15452495", "price": 85, "review": "I stayed here by myself and it was a comfortable and convenient crash pad. The neighborhood has many restaurants and bars. The photos were accurate, although the apartment is rather small and might be too tight for more than one person to stay comfortably.  The layout of the apartment is also quite strange; the shower and bathroom are basically in separate closets through the bedroom.  The location is great but the building isn't in the best shape.  This was a fine apartment to crash in alone, but I wouldn't recommend it to a couple or group."}
