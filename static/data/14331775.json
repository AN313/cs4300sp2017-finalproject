{"description": "Apt. is very conveniently located a few blocks from almost every subway line (N,Q, R, 4, 5, 6, F). It is right by Central Park, museums, Bloomingdales, lots of great restaurants, Whole Foods, manicure + pedicure places, salons, the Plaza Hotel, Madison Ave., Park Ave., Fifth Ave., etc. It is good for solo adventurers and business travelers. No guests please. The building is on a very quiet, tree-lined street of private homes. It has a doorman Monday through Friday 7am-11pm and a laundry room.", "name": "Beautiful, Spacious Studio In VERY Convenient Area", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7da29913-8b9a-4dec-b2f8-b3c6a2ec5f60.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14331775", "id": "14331775", "price": 150, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival.
