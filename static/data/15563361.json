This is definitely a lived-in apartment so be aware that there are plenty of personal items in the house and that it's not a spare rental. There are two levels of stairs to climb up to, however, they are big and easy stairs and should not be a problem for most people. The  very cozy outdoor terrace was a really nice feature."}
