{"description": "My place is close to Fresh Fanatic, Brooklyn Roasting Company, Il Porto, and Brooklyn Heights. You\u2019ll love my place because of the sunshine (a rarity in this city!), the plants that provide respite from the busy concrete, the sense of quiet retreat. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nGuests will have the entire apartment to themselves, including a full bedroom with queen sized bed, kitchenette, bath room with bathtub, plant-filled sun nook and living room with a large desk.\n\nI am available to answer questions and help where necessary.\n\nFort Greene is one of Brooklyn's most desirable neighborhoods. It has some of New York's most beautiful 19th century architecture, awesome parks, cute cafes, bars, and bookshops. It was the home of Walt Whitman and is now frequented by writers such as Jhumpa Lahiri and artists such as Glenn Ligon. I could not think of anywhere I'd rather stay!\n\nThere are buses on two adjacent streets, and the apartment is walking distance from the G train, which crosses Brooklyn. It is also walking distance (though a longer walk) to Dekalb station, with the Q train that is one stop from Manhattan.\n\nThis is strictly a non-smoking apartment in a quiet building of only four apartments. Please respect the neighbors.", "name": "Charming 1BR in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/49464437-dad7-4be1-a6d9-7a7d72c9dda4.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14853361", "id": "14853361", "price": 108, "review": "Macushla is a great host!
