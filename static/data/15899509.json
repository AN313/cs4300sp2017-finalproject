{"description": "My place is close to Astoria Park, Astoria Park Pool, express bus to Manhattan and  just few blocks to N, Q trains and express bus to 7 train and Queensboro bridge. You\u2019ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the coziness, the light, and the kitchen. My place is good for couples and families (with kids).\n\nIs a beautiful 1 bedroom first floor  apartment, the living room has a room divider that accommodates comfortably a twin size bed, the futon can be used as an extra bed, access to a full kitchen.  My place is  cozy and tidy is located in a very quiet and safe area of Astoria, you will find fine cuisine and bars just  at walking distance .", "name": "Beautiful 1 bedroom apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/aae3f20c-53ee-4f9d-951e-510ad6e1d06a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15899509", "id": "15899509", "price": 89, "review": "Nice bright clean place.
