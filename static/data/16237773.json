{"description": "My place is close to Central Park Zoo, Columbus Circle, and Per Se. You\u2019ll love my place because of The apt faces the back of the building and it\u00b4s very silent, the location is quite convenient 3 blocks away from Hunter College Station, two blocks away from madison ave and lots of good restaurants in the  neighborhood.\n. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Quiet and beautiful apartment near central park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/66715a3f-41f2-40cc-adc4-42c28303a028.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16237773", "id": "16237773", "price": 160, "review": "Stayed with a friend during Christmas and New Years, unfortunately did not get to meet Nicole who was out of town but she was still very responsive with communication. Check in went smoothly with her cousin helping to hand over the keys. The space was great for 2 with plenty of room in a very artsy studio setup. I loved the book collection! The location was nice and quiet but not too far from public transport and Grand Central Park. We had a blast and would recommend any respectful guest to stay in this quite unique and beautiful apartment!"}
