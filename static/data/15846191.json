The place was a steal for the location it's in, the tv had a guest Netflix and the kitchen and bathroom had more than the essentials. Sonia kept us informed when need be and the apartment was quiet. My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 was the inaccuracy with the check out time. I picked this place because the check out time was listed as 3pm, but the night before I was supposed to check out Sonia informed me I had to be out at 11:30Am at the latest, even though the ad always said 3pm. I had to change my plans for the next day, which was disappointing because it meant less time in the city. I thought about asking for some money back, but decided not to. This is my only complaint."}
