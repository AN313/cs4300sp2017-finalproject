{"description": "This is a spacious and quiet one bedroom apartment on the third floor of a walk-up townhouse.  Near the J/M/Z trains at Marcy Ave., L train at Bedford Ave. and the G train at Metropolitan Ave.  Surrounded by many bars and restaurants of South Williamsburg and just a short walk to vibrant North Williamsburg.  Close to supermarkets, delis, drug stores, etc. Just a few blocks from the waterfront.    \n\nMy place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nAlthough located in a vibrant part of Brooklyn, the apartment is quiet and peaceful.\n\nGuests have access to the whole apartment, except for the closet. Upon request, guests can have a garment rack and hangers to hang their clothes. \n\nThere is a television with the cables to connect an Apple TV. If you bring your own Apple TV, you can connect it to the television\n\nI always try to greet my guests in person to give them a quick tour and answer any questions.  After guests settle in, I rarely see them. However, I am\nalways accessible by phone.\n\nThe apartment is walking distance to cultural centers, parks/gardens, the water front, supermarkets, restaurants and a vibrant nightlife. The L, G, J, M,  and Z trains are also a short walk away. These trains can take you to just about every part of the city, including airports and major transportation hubs.\n\nThe television has cables that can be connected to an Apple TV.
