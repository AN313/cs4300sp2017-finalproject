Cosy and charming. It's not in the best part of Bushwick, but it is walking-distance from cool cafes and restaurants (Sunrise/Sunset, one of my favourite bars, is only a few blocks away). The apartment is also a convenient 2-minute walk from the J train and 10-minute walk from the L train. Shelly herself was super sweet and helpful and answered my emails quickly even though she was out of the country. "}
