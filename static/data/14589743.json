{"description": "My place is close to Nitehawk Cinema, Maison Premiere, Union Pool, L train, Williamsburg Bridge, Mesa Coyoacan, Variety Cafe. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location, the neighborhood, and the outdoors space. My place is good for couples and furry friends (pets).\n\nOur apartment is a railroad 2 bedroom technically, so we have an office and a bedroom on top of our huge living room and kitchen. The living room has a nice sectional that turns into a big full size pull out if you want it too. Our back patio is private and all yours for you stay!\n\nThe whole apartment is yours for the stay, including laundry in the basement if you need to do a load!\n\nAbsolutely feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the apartment, neighborhood or just the city in general!\n\nWilliamsburg is one of the coolest areas in the city. There's tons of shops and restaurants, as well as hot spots at night for either casual hang outs or cocktails with a view. Our apartment is just enough off the beaten path so you're not disturbed by the loads of people that flock to this part of town, but close enough to walk or bike to if you so wish!\n\nThe L train is just a block away, we are 3 stops outside of the city. Literally a 5 minute train ride to manhattan. Also the G train is about 3.5 blocks if you're looking to get around in Brooklyn or Queens. We also have two bikes in our backyard that you're more than welcome to use, they come with helmets!", "name": "Huge one bedroom apartment with private patio!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f4e74722-ba91-4125-a81c-f70b229bb443.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14589743", "id": "14589743", "price": 110, "review": "Host was great, waiting for us and personally explained everything.
