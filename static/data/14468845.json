{"description": "Short blocks from either the heart of Chinatown or the Lower east side in Manhattan . . You\u2019ll love the location and while its a small (400sq ft) 4th floor walk-up , It has all the necessities , kitchen , two tv's with roku (netflix , HBO go , Amazon Prime) , Wifi , queen sized bed , AC .  My place is good for couples (me and my gf currently live there but we go away on weekends sometimes) and solo adventurers.", "name": "Lower Manhattan Studio on  LES historic street", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4957a93c-256b-4bbf-932c-a0e9cbeb568c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14468845", "id": "14468845", "price": 115, "review": "Carlos was very friendly , easy to talk to during , before and after the stay . He was very  accommodating  and made our  New Year's Eve stay in New York City stress free specially this was a last minute booking during a very busy time of the year . He was available to answer all questions at any time of day even late at night wether regarding the stay or the city . He left us clean towels , water and coffee. The location is great , very close to subway and in Chinatown easy to get to other parts of the city . He even allowed us to stay after our check out time and offered us to stay an extra day if we wanted to . Great host . Thank you "}
