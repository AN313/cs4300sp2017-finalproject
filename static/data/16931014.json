{"description": "My place is close to Dun-Well Doughnuts. You\u2019ll love my place because of the light, the neighborhood, the comfy bed, and the kitchen. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\nThe apartment is very well located. The L train is just two blocks away, which takes you to Manhattan in 20 minutes. There is also the J, M, and G line nearby.\nWe also have the B43 bus that take us to Greenpoint and Williamsburg in less than 15 minutes.\nUnbeatable location!", "name": "Large and sunny apartment in Brooklyn, 3BR", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/442c9c5b-3f02-4238-9ded-fdbd413f6b48.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16931014", "id": "16931014", "price": 210}
