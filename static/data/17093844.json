It is definitely a large one bedroom. The four of us fit in the bedroom still having room to walk around. And there's still more room for another air mattress in the living room. Everything we needed was there. The apartment is close to parks and the subway. It's easy to get into the city from the apartment, but there's also lots of great food and things to do within walking distance of the apartment. \nJake was excellent communicating with us prior to our arrival and while we there. He was very flexible in delaying our check out when a snow storm made it difficult for us to leave when we had planned. We would definitely stay at Jake's place again!"}
