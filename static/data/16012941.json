{"description": "We recently moved into a cozy bright 1 bedroom apt on the upper west side! We are steps away from the subway (1,2,3 line). It is a elevator building. My place is close to Dive Bar , Whole Foods Market, and a ton more restaurants and bars. You\u2019ll love my place because of the light, the comfy bed, and the high ceilings. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Just beware, it can be very noisy during rush hour and at night as we are located at a major cross section.", "name": "Cozy NYC apt!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/468c7ac3-c4b2-4067-a42d-dda9dc53b202.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16012941", "id": "16012941", "price": 250, "review": "Wonderful apartment, great location. A little street noise from the busy intersection, but our hosts were very honest about that and that's just how the neighborhood is, not a problem for us. Proximity to the express train is fantastic! The accommodations were lovely, Marina and her husband are very thoughtful hosts with great taste in decor to boot. Highly recommended!"}
