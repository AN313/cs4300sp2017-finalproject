{"description": "Great little apartment for small groups that don't plan on staying indoors too much. This apartment is nothing fancy - but supplies a good nights rest.\n\nMy place is close to Saint Vitus Bar, Milk & Roses, and Glasserie. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\n4 bedroom apartment - kitchen and bathroom.\n\nThere will be air conditioners installed once the weather goes above 75 degrees.\n\nOur guests are more than welcome to use the kitchen for simple meal preparations. Feel free to use kitchen appliances, silverware, and cookware.\n\nMy Co-Host and I very familiar with the Greenpoint and Williamsburg area - please don't hesitate to ask for recommendations! We\u2019ve both been in the area for 10+ years.\n\nGreenpoint has a lot to offer much like Williamsburg. It's growing so quickly with new bars and restaurants popping up everywhere. Lots of walking traffic and convenient stores.\n\nG Train is a 9-minute walk.\nL Train is a 15-minute bus ride or 30-minute walk.\nEast River Ferry is a 3-minute walk.
