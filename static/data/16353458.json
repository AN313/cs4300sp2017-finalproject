One sectionnal sofa that can be used if more than 4 people, heat units in the rooms, TV and Wifi.\n\nGreenpoint is one of my favourite areas in Brooklyn, definately my favourite to live in! It is quite, charming, lively at the same time, it is less than 20 minutes away from Grand Central, Manhattan, and yet so protected from the city crazyness. It is very close to the bustling nightlife of Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Manhattan.\n\nThe G train (Green line) is only a few blocks (3min walk). The 7 train (Purple) is a 10 minute walk across the Polaski bridge (very nice views of the city), 15 minutes to Grand Central.", "name": "Cozy and sunny 2 BR apartment in trendy Greenpoint", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/64e3e9a2-51c9-43b9-b181-c1f41936aa80.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16353458", "id": "16353458", "price": 150, "review": "The apartment is located close to many great coffee shops and restaurants and just across the bridge to Manhattan.
