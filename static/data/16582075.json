The location is ideal for venturing all over the city. Very close to the subway stop and lots of things to do right there in the neighborhood. Christopher was very welcoming helped us with our bags up the four flights and made himself easily available for our entire stay. Private balcony is a great touch. Would definitely recommend and  would stay again! Thanks Chris!"}
