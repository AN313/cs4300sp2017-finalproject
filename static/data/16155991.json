{"description": "Cozy 1 bedroom apartment in the heart of Bedstuy! Tons of light, large bedroom, comfy living room with a work area nook, dining table, and full kitchen. Across the street from two bars (Skytown and Divine), Stay Fresh Deli (vegan and vegetarian eats), Mr. Kiwis for all the juice lovers (open 24/7) and a 5 minute walk to Little Mo's, Little Skips, Birdy's. Literally a 1 minute walk to the JMZ train station! Great for those coming from JFK. 15 minutes to downtown Manhattan!", "name": "Comfy 1 Bedroom Flat Near JMZ Trains and More!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ec8d1ed3-5c8c-4e2e-9f95-d78000a2bd15.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16155991", "id": "16155991", "price": 95, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival.
