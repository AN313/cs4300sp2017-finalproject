{"description": "My place is close to subway station and close to many good dinning places. You\u2019ll love my place because of the views, the location, and the outdoors space. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).\n\nThe subway 7 is just 3 mins from my apartment. It is really easy to get into Manhattan.", "name": "Bright Manhattan view studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1fa2ef80-deed-4378-b1b2-a3f828717e77.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15677740", "id": "15677740", "price": 130, "review": "Ask about TV instructions."}
