{"description": "My cool and relaxing one bedroom apartment sits in Historic Harlem New York. One block from the 2/3 train. Also a 15minute ride to Times Square and 40min ride to Brooklyn Bridge. A few blocks from the historic 125th St and the Apollo Theatre. Many famous restaurants such as Sylvia's and Red Rooster.  We have a 24hr doorman able to help with any questions or requests. Quiet floor and cool neighbors. My place is perfect for families, couples or in town for business. 15mins to Laguardia Airport!\n\nThis place is unique that outside of Air Bnb this is my home. So I take great pride in keeping it clean and comfortable.\n\nGuests will have access to whole place. Laundry room is in basement along with vending machines!\n\nI rarely interact with guests since majority of time I'm traveling for work.\nIf needed you can reach me by cell to answer any questions.\n\nI love the history of Harlem, the Arts, history and great food!\n\n2/3 train is one block away. Bus stop is on Lenox Ave and cabs are easy to hail also download the apps for Lyft and Uber.", "name": "The Wine Down", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/124d2ae5-eb65-4ec4-9f26-f45b3b403e9c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16827732", "id": "16827732", "price": 120, "review": "Rex is a great host and The Wine Down is a great value. It's clean and spacious. We stayed there with our two teenage daughters. One slept on the couch the other on a blowup mattress. The location is great for access to the 2 & 3 lines. A good grocery store is only two blocks away (skip the one by McDonald's). Lots of good restaurants are within a short walk or a couple subway stop (max). \n\nBest feature is Ralph, the nighttime doorman. What a jewel. Tell him Joe says, \"Hi.\""}
