It was well equipped with kitchen and bathroom supplies, and had a TV that we got to watch the ball drop on in HD. It was also close to public trans to travel to the show. The place was cozy and quaint and conveniently located on the first floor of the building. Lastly, Haoying was very flexible with check-in/check-out times, which made our trip easier! I would definitely recommend this place. "}
