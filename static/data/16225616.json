Their home is cozy and recently renewed, very well equipped, even with some high tech appliances, to stay at home at a rainy day.\n\nThey also let us stay in a late check out, due to our flight was late at night. \n\nThe apartment was neat and clean, and was a real pleasure to stay. Access to subway and restaurants are really close. (3 blocks or less)\n\nEric and Jenny were so polite and considered, even they left a card and a bottle of champagne due to Christmas season.\n\n I defenetely would chose this place again."}
