{"description": "Located in one of New York's most charming neighborhoods, our apartment is set within a beautiful pre-war brownstone. With an intimate atmosphere, giving you the impression that you've just stepped into your home away from home, you'll find yourself in proximity of legendary jazz clubs, great shopping, an exclusive bar scene, and comedy clubs.\n\nLocated directly on 3+ subway lines, with 6 more within walking distance, it's perfect for couples, adventure travelers, and business travelers alike.\n\nWe have a full kitchen, inviting living room with an extraordinarily comfortable couch and 55\" curved TV, complete with Netflix, so you can watch any movie or show after a long day of sight seeing. We also have a cozy bed to fall into to give your feet a rest. So do make yourself at home!\n\nAcross the street is a great little restaurant called Westville, though you can fall into a great cafe, restaurant, lounge, or shop no matter which direction you go coming out of our place. It's also close to the West Side Highway, for a stroll along the Hudson.\n\nThe 1 Train is on our corner, and the A,C,E, B,D,F,M trains are a 5 minute walk. Cabs are also very easily accessible from our neighborhood.", "name": "Perfect West Village Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1089beff-0481-4ebb-9cd6-448990874a5b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17210810", "id": "17210810", "price": 170, "review": "Beautiful place and terrific location.
