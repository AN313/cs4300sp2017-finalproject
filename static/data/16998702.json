It's a few minutes walking distance from the L train, which made it really easy to get to the places that we wanted to go to. Bedford Avenue has so many restaurants and bars to choose from and has a pharmacy and Whole Foods a few blocks down in case we needed supplies/food. As a runner, I was pleased to find the on-ramp to the Williamsburg Bridge a couple of blocks down the same street! \n\nThe actual place was very accommodating for me and my 3 guests. We all had a queen-sized bed to sleep in, an island countertop with spacious living room. We felt very secure in the apartment complex and it wasn't noisy at all, making it easy to sleep. Street parking was super easy to find. Sean made the key process very simple and he was quick to respond to any questions that we had. I would definitely recommend staying at his place when visiting this lively, hip area of Brooklyn."}
