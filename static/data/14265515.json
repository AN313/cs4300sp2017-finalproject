{"description": "My place is close to the L train and 5 min walk from great bars, restaurants and event spaces such as House of Yes and The Johnson's. You\u2019ll love my place because of its charm. This large one bedroom has lots of natural light with separate living room and kitchen. The place is loaded with plants and good vibes. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).", "name": "Plants and Charm in Bushwick One Bed", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0c206777-a300-4f18-a801-d53c09894ad5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14265515", "id": "14265515", "price": 126, "review": "Robert advertised his space accurately, communicated promptly, and made the entire experience easy.
