{"description": "My little home is in the very heart of East Village. When you step out the door, you'll have hundreds of restaurants, bars and entertainment to choose from. It's also a 5 min walk to the F, 6, N and R train, and a 10 min walk to the L train. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the high ceilings, and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nAs you can tell from the photos, my place is small! But it's perfect for 1-2 people. My apartment is really the true East Village experience! It's drenched in sunlight with maximized space.\n\nHappy to help with any restaurant or travel tips! I've been in the city for 4+ years and am a major foodie so I love giving suggestions.\n\nA five minute walk to the F train, and an eight minute walk to the 6, N, Q, R and L trains.\n\nMy place has multiple flights of stairs! Pack lightly and DM me for specific details.", "name": "Quiet, Bright Apt in the Heart of East Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d1dfa439-19a2-4a1e-a84e-f09f5e66f57a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15964959", "id": "15964959", "price": 175, "review": "Casey's apartment is in a great location in the East Village, convenient to many restaurants, public transportation, and nightlife. The apartment has everything you need for your stay. Casey was incredibly responsive when we had issues (completely our fault!!!) and flexible with our needs.  Highly recommend this place!! "}
