{"description": "My place is close to Central Cafe in Bushwick, the L train, and JFK Airport.  You\u2019ll love my place because of the hip neighborhood, the exposed brick ambiance, and the quick ride to Manhattan and JFK Airport. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe apartment gets lots of light and contains wonderful exposed brick and modern appliances.\n\nGuests will have access to everything shown in the pictures: the bedroom, the kitchen, bathroom, desk area, and a backyard (not shown in photos).\n\nI always try to be as available as possible and am very responsive.\n\nBushwick is one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn and offers a lot to the traveller. There are many great restaurants nearby -- many of which are priced reasonably. The transportation to Manhattan, Williamsburg, and JFK Airport is quick and easy.\n\nThe apartment is a 2-minute walk from the JMZ train and from the L train as well. Both subway stations are open all night. For directions, I recommend (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps, because there is sometimes track work (especially at night and on weekends).\n\nAn artist (landlord's relative) uses the area underneath the apartment to paint and occasionally for sleeping when he works late. Unfortunately, the only entry-point into that area is through the apartment itself, so you will see him come and go from time to time.", "name": "Charming Exposed Brick - 23m to Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a90c1b25-c2ec-429f-a08f-395b446c1b44.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15755492", "id": "15755492", "price": 79, "review": "The place was great! The only thing that missed was the hair dryer. The subway is 2 minutes walking from the appartement, and there is a supermarket, kfc, McDonald's & Dunkin donuts nearby. The two guys were really nice with us. I would totally recommend this place."}
