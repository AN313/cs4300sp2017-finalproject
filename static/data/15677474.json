The apartment was cozy, comfortable, clean and in a great neighbourhood. There was a subway stop near by but we preferred to walk and take in as much of this wonderful city as we could. Communication with both Jamie and Michelle was fantastic and everything about our stay (check-in/out) went smoothly. Thank you Jamie! \n\nP.S: A stop at The Big Gay Ice Cream Shop and Buvette are a must when staying here!"}
