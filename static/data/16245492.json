You will also have access to the gym.\n\nUnfortunately I will be out of town during the whole time, so likely I will either ask concierge to help me manage or my friends to take care of the hand-over process.\n\nOn Morningside Heights, safe and quiet.\n\n5mins walk to #1 and C train.", "name": "Spacious Studio Unit on Morningside Heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1803045f-7908-44bd-b2bd-13e98dbd3f61.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16245492", "id": "16245492", "price": 110, "review": "Pour une premi\u00e8re location et qui plus est \u00e0 new york c'\u00e9tait vraiment bien. je recommande"}
