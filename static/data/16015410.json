The apartment is even larger and nicer than the photos suggest. The bedroom is quiet and clean, the living area and kitchen equipped with everything you would need. James was a great host -  very easy to communicate with and accommodating. On a gorgeous and quiet tree lined street in Chelsea, near many restaurants. Highly recommend! Would definitely stay here again. "}
