{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of offering a premier Long Island City location just a subway stop from Grand Central Station, and mere steps from the new Riverside Esplanade and Gantry Plaza State Park. Blocks from local specialty eateries, while offering spectacular views of the Manhattan & the East River.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families with kids and pet ( please limit to one domesticated pet).\n\nIt is on the first floor no need to use stairs nor elevators =).\n\nLIC, is one of the best neighborhoods in Queens, NY\n\n3 blocks away to  Vernon Boulevard train station where you can take the 7 train to Grand Central. This means you will be in Midtown Manhattan in just 4 min.", "name": "apartment few steps away from the East River", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d47ca028-76ee-4c4c-8f6a-f026ad5b5c8e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16287134", "id": "16287134", "price": 150, "review": "The overall location was amazing; a very short walk to Gantry Park and the waterfront with spectacular views of the city, more interesting restaurants than you can imagine and the people in that part of LIC are friendly and helpful. \n\nUnfortunately, the ground floor apartment is right next to a business (painting?) that is very loud (even by city norms) and starts operations well before 6 am.\n\nThe futon was not really usable as a second bed so it could use replacement. The apartment overall could use a little TLC - reasonably clean but a few well-chosen upgrades (mattress, futon, chairs) would go a long way to improving the usability.\n\nChristina did her best to make things right and was very friendly and helpful."}
