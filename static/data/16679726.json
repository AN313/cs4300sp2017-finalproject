The last few years lots of young professional and hipsters have discovered the neighborhoods. Astoria has long been a favorite neighborhood with many families living there for generations. Here are a few of the many reasons to consider staying in Astoria.\nAstoria is 10 minutes or less from Midtown Manhattan. The N and Q subways lines run through the heart of the neighborhood, above 31st Street. and R or M along Broadway. It's also a hop, skip, and short drive over the Triborough Bridge to Harlem and to the Bronx. \nAstoria Park is smack on the East River with gorgeous views of Upper Manhattan and the Queensboro and Hellgate Bridges. And Robert Moses' Astoria Pool is the king of all outdoor city pools.\nAstoria has always been known for Greek food (it is the Greek capital of NYC), and lately it has gained a reputation for fine dining and innovative cooking.\nThe only old-school, big beer garden left in New York City, Bohemian Hall is wonderful. Turn off crazy urban 31st Street--the subway overhead--and escape into this huge beer garden with its shady trees, picnic tables, pitchers of icy beer, and platters of hearty Czech food and barbecue. It's a must on summer weekends with stein-thumping live folk music on many afternoons. Bohemia Beer Garden is a true urban oasis for families, visitors, and a cast of neighborhood regulars.\nThe arts are picking up steam in Astoria. Local culture is led by the innovative American Museum of the Moving Image. It is one of the finest museums in New York City for kids, for adults, and definitely for movie aficionados.", "name": "New & Modern 1 Bed. 10 Min. to Manhattan!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/048a5187-db8f-4a23-bd25-89054af9f2c9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16679726", "id": "16679726", "price": 99}
