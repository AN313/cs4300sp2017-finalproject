{"description": "My place is close to The C train. It's so quick and easy to get into the city and a straight shot to most touristy destinations. 30 mins train ride to time square, Central Park. 20 mins to Soho and West Village! And a quick walk to Barclays Center, Clinton Hill and Fort Greene. You\u2019ll love my place because of Convenience and quiet nights. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). And anyone looking for a clean relaxed place to sleep!", "name": "Clinton Hill artist studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/29d83a96-be9b-40c7-9137-d8abe5570b7f.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17280849", "id": "17280849", "price": 100}
