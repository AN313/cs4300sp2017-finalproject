{"description": "My place is close to the Apollo, Sylvia's, and Red Rooster, Cove, Central Park and other attractions.\n\nI have a quaint sectional, dinette table and a mini bar to make this place like home. This space is perfect for 3. Possibly 4 with additional cost.\n\nYou will have gate access and my entry door access.\n\nI have someone in the complex that can provide you with a key.\n\nThe neighborhood is quiet and my neighbors are as well.\n\nClose to the ABC, 456, and the 2/3. Easy access to uber and taxi cabs.", "name": "Cozy, Spacious One Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/21d043ee-1ffd-41e5-bfd2-7bd3e9acbcaa.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16441881", "id": "16441881", "price": 150, "review": "Host did everything to make my stay well.
