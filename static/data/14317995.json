{"description": "One bedroom apt, located in the heart of the Upper East Side, 3rd Ave. Nice clean building, just 1 flight of stairs. The apt is comfy, clean, bright and airy.  Close to the Met, Central Park and the Subway. You\u2019ll love my place because it's close to all of the splendor that is quintessentially New York/UES with a plethora of choices for dining, drinking or just relaxing for a morning, afternoon or evening stroll. Good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Central Park & Met Museum 1 Bedroom Gem!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c70f0b8d-2a56-42eb-a828-99939560a3f1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14317995", "id": "14317995", "price": 175, "review": "I had a fantastic time staying at Richard's apartment in Upper East Side. Its extremely clean and comfortable. Also very well located next to some great restaurants/bars and within walking distance to the metro & central park. Richard was very accommodating and even let me check in early since I arrived on an early morning flight. I would happily stay at Richards place again, and would recommend to anyone."}
