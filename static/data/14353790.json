{"description": "My place is down the block from the famous Levain Bakery, a short walk from the American Museum of Natural History and across the park from The Met. Central and Riverside Parks are close.  Right off the 2/3 express subway all parts of NYC are easy to access, like Columbia University and the Theater District. The neighborhood boasts great restaurants and bars. The apt has nice light with a terrace that looks over the Beacon Theater. The building has a furnished roof deck you can use as well.", "name": "Upper West Side Dream Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/214c0c79-4b34-4863-a246-497d2d973cbf.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14353790", "id": "14353790", "price": 130, "review": "This place was AMAZING! Very clean, well stocked, and well organized. Isabel was an incredible host - always very responsive and helpful. She even left me an instruction sheet with all of the important info for the apartment. 100% would recommend."}
