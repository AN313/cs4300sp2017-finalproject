Even while his traveling, he responded very quickly for any of my questions. His place was very clean and comfortable. Sofa bed was big enough for two people to sleep. Also his neighbors were so kind that they helped us a lot. It was less than 30 minutes to go to most areas in Manhattan. Thank you for accepting my request, Misha :)"}
