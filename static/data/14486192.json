{"description": "My place is close to Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Central Park. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location.\n\nUpper East side is a fantastic location, lost of restaurants, bars, and cafes. Few blocks from Central Park and main city attractions. Easy going community and quite building.\n\nMetro Line 6 and buses M96 and M86 to go east to west. Parking lots in proximity to my building average cost per day around 35 USD. Off-street parking is allowed but look for signs and regulations they are strictly enforced in NYC avoid getting a ticket and ride the public transportation.", "name": "Studio with perfect location", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/815afbaa-40e0-4ed5-aebb-11d053b47c2d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14486192", "id": "14486192", "price": 105, "review": "The place was nice and cozy for 2 people.
