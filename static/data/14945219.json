{"description": "My sunny art loft is close to House of Yes, Maria Hernandez Park, a large organic grocery store, many artist studio buildings, Bushwick Collective murals, AP Cafe, Tortilleria Los Hermanos, The Cobra Club, and The Johnson's. You\u2019ll love my place because of the art in the apt and in the street, the neighborhood, the light, the cute cat, and the wifi. The loft is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. 15 minutes to Union Square / center of New York City / Manhattan via L train\n\nThis is a open loft with sunlight, facing an alley between two large buildings - rare in a city of railroad style apartments. Wood floors, lots of art, and 3 blocks from the L train.\n\nKitchen stocked with appliances and spices\nHair dryer\nWifi\n\nMyself or my partner will check on the cat and water the plants every day or two for a few minutes.\n\nI have lived in the neighborhood for eight years. It is very artistic and is currently getting modernized, with a lot of new bars and restaurants opening up. There's easy access to a lot of event spaces and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nJefferson L train stop at Wyckoff and Jefferson", "name": "Sunny Art Loft in Bushwick, Brooklyn + 1 Cute Cat", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/43ddac45-2212-4aa9-b41f-a1b62b9bbc3d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14945219", "id": "14945219", "price": 139, "review": "Julia's place was great.
