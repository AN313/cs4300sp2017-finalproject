{"description": "A few blocks from the most reliable train in Brooklyn, my home is comfy, colorful, & fun!\n\nFantastic for a getaway to NYC with all the amenities you need. The building has a gorgeous backyard and rooftop for outdoor time and is quiet at night (unlike most of the city)! Complete with wifi, a washer/dryer, dishwasher, over/stove, & built-in AC and heat, I'm sure you will feel right at home!\n\nWith tons of fun collectibles, clothes, & funky decor, my home is the perfect backdrop for your NYC trip!\n\nMy space is decked out with funky objects everywhere. It's a great spot for taking photos and every time you walk into a room you'll notice something new.\n\nIt's really cozy and a great place to hang out at the end of a long day!\n\nThe second bedroom can be turned into a bedroom with an air mattress. If you are needing one you can either get it or alert me and I'll have one shipped!\n\nThere is a roof shared by all tenants as well as a backyard\n\nI'll be gone when you are there but completely available by phone or text. I usually will have a friend on call if you run into any problems during your stay!\n\nBed Stuy is so quiet and so easily accessed by the city. The apartment is really close to the JMZ subway train which takes you into manhattan.\n\nI recommend Chez Alex, a cafe on the corner of Madison and Ralph. They have great coffee and sandwiches.\n\nThe house is near the JMZ trains on Broadway at Gates Avenue. These trains always run frequently (generally under 10 minutes).", "name": "Eclectic & Cozy Home Perfect for Fun!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/29254721-70b8-4fd9-9819-d5e1c4af330b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16189563", "id": "16189563", "price": 110}
