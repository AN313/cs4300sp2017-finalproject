{"description": "My apartment is very clean, comfortable and in an ideal location in Brooklyn. One block away from G, J/Z lines and about an 8-minute walk to the L. Lots of restaurants and bars around and a great grocery store, coffeeshop and wine shop just around the corner. Neighbors are friendly and quiet. I don't like a lot of clutter, so it's a relatively minimal place, perfect for the lone traveler or couple.", "name": "Charming apt in central location!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ccd3cda0-509e-4eb2-b839-a6fe6d195226.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17095555", "id": "17095555", "price": 110}
