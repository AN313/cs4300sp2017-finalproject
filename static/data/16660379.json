While much of the neighborhood is residential, Downtown Flushing, centered on the northern end of Main Street in Queens, is a large commercial and retail area and is the fourth largest central business district in New York City.\n\nFlushing's diversity is reflected by the numerous ethnic groups that reside there, including people of Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, and African American ancestry. It is part of the Fifth Congressional District, which encompasses the entire northeastern shore of Queens County, and extends into neighboring Nassau County. Flushing is served by five railroad stations on the Long Island Rail Road Port Washington Branch, as well as the New York City Subway's 7 Flushing Line, which has its terminus at Main Street. The intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue is the third busiest intersection in New York City, behind Times and Herald Squares.\n\n\u2022 Parking space in front of house.

A very clean and modern house, with an added bonus of having a driveway to park a car, which come in very handy for me. \n\nEmily was a fantastic host, with great communication before, during and after my stay. She even left supplies in the house for when I arrived, which was greatly appreciated. Emily was very helpful answering any questions I had. It was a very relaxing stay, and New York is only 20 minutes away by train, with local buses running directly to flushing Main Street station not far from the house. \n\nWould definitely recommend, and would return again!
