{"description": "My beloved little apartment is close to Central Park, museum mile, the east river esplanade and the boutiques, bars and restaurants of Manhattan's Upper East Side. It's on a quiet tree-lined street and features a quirky, cosy living space and peaceful, light-drenched bedroom.

Ceri was so welcoming and helpful--from giving me a beer that was much-needed after 24 hours of air travel to answering questions about places to eat and drink in the area. She was prompt about communicating before and during my stay. And her cat, Chester, is the best. "}
