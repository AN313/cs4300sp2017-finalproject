Il est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able pour une famille de 4 personnes avec 2 (voire 3) enfants. La rue, avec ses brownstone houses, est charmante. Les avenues alentour le sont moins, mais ont l'avantage de vous donner acc\u00e8s aux points centraux de la ville gr\u00e2ce au m\u00e9tro, \u00e0 5 mn de l'appartement. Notre fils a particuli\u00e8rement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la playstation..., mais il y avait aussi un bon choix de DVD et un tr\u00e8s bel \u00e9cran pour en profiter. Ephra\u00efm pourra vous conseiller une tr\u00e8s bonne adresse, \u00e0 quelques minutes, pour \u00e9couter du jazz dans un endroit qu'il faut garder secret ! Nous avons pass\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s bonnes vacances et recommandons vivement l'appartement, qui rend NY accessible \u00e0 tous points de vue !"}
