It's one of the only apartment that has 5 windows. Partying isn't allowed. Everything is included in the price including netflix and hbo go. Washing and Drying is outside the building. There is also a washer and dryer by the pound right at the corner. Feel free to contact me for anything you need!

Supermarkets really close, subway close too.  The apartment was sunny and it was nice to wake up to the kids arriving for school next door.  And Julian was very easy to deal with, prompt and flexible with check in and quick to respond. A great stay."}
