I had a significant flight delay due to Hurricane Hermine and Alek was very accommodating arranging my arrival even late at night. My stay was incredibly comfortable and the location was perfect. The UWS has many great restaurants and this apartment's close location to Central Park and public transportation was incredibly ideal. I would definitely stay here again in the future. This is the perfect space and location for single travelers or couples looking for a real New York City experience."}
