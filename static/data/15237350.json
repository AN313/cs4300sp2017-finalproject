{"description": "Our place is close to Strivers' Row, Ponty Bistro, Harlem Nights, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, Red Rooster and Harlem's Floridita. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, families and furry friends (pets).\n\nThe space is completely private and not a shared unit.\n\nI am available by email should you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThe neighborhood is very vibrant and a true reflection of bustling Harlem. If you're seeking a super quiet apartment, then this isn't suitable for you. During the warmer months, you'll hear music playing and see children playing in the streets. It's not uncommon to see the older women of the neighborhood congregating out on the front stoop.\n\nThe 2/3 train is four blocks away at 135th street and 145th street stop. The's also buses on Lennox Avenue.", "name": "Harlem Luxe Getaway", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fe5da0b0-916d-4615-b2e7-0089ce0b144a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15237350", "id": "15237350", "price": 150, "review": "This place was perfect for my wife and me. We felt at home the minute we walked in to this unusually large apt. It was a beautiful area with a lot to see. Subway is a couple of blocks in either direction and a bus stop just on the nearest corner. There are (3) large grocery stores within four blocks which is handy because you have a fully functional kitchen. There is a convenience store and Laundromat on every block. More food places than you can throw rocks at if you want to eat out. The building and street area are kept very clean. You can see the pride of the people in the neighborhood. I hope we can come back again and stay in the very same apt. Also at the end of the day and miles of walking is the comfortable bed! You wont be disappointed staying here and will likely be sad when you hand back the keys."}
