{"description": "This spacious studio apartment is perfect for couples or solo adventurers wanting to get a taste of the big city. High enough up so it's quiet in the apartment, but walk out the front door and you're immediately immersed in the buzz of the city. Plenty of affordable grocery stores, including one right across the street, and a wide open kitchen for cooks. Deli's are accessible 24 hours, and deliver. There is 24 hour security, a tree and flower lined entrance, and million dollar view from the apt.", "name": "Sunny & Spacious Studio with Amazing View", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ef3b1bd7-42db-4ed8-b80a-cd157f066ea7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15146978", "id": "15146978", "price": 95, "review": "Extremely convenient, about 5mins of walking distance from tube station.
