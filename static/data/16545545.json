{"description": "This comfy space is the best uptown has to offer! It's located 2 blocks from the A and 1 trains that can have you in midtown in 20 min! You're steps away from The Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Inwood Hill Park and trails that run down the Hudson and Harlem Rivers.  \n\nMost major banks/pharmacies/retailers, Starbucks, grocery stores, laundromats, and gyms are on your block. There is easy street parking and several garages with space nearby!\n\nIt's warm and inviting because of the cool color pallet I've used and it's quiet and cozy.  This newly renovated apartment has all new appliances plus 56 inch flatscreen tv, with surround sound Apple tv, Chromecast, and Canon color printer.  Feel free to play the colorful piano or keyboard!\n\nAll rooms and common spaces (whole apartment)\n\nI am always reachable by text or phone, but like to give guests space to enjoy their stay in New York.\n\nEverything I need is here. It's very convenient.\n\nThe A express train and 1 local train are both 2 blocks from me, and the express bus stops on my street. There are also several other bus lines, and the east side and west side highways can almost be seen from my street as well.", "name": "Gorgeous Renovated 2BD in Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/548927a0-e514-4d3d-9dd1-cae0fe7a4fa6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16545545", "id": "16545545", "price": 139, "review": "The Flat is really nice, cozy and comfortable.
