Everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay (kitchen, bath tub, large comfy bed, good wifi and television). Perfect location for seeing all the sights the city has to offer: close to the subway, supermarket downstairs in the building and just a street away from the Empire State! Everything we needed to make or trip extra special (and a lovely balcony view of Third Avenue was the icing on the cake!)."}
