Guests not registered on this trip are not allowed so you can enjoy the entire place to your self, with your significant other, or 3 people in total.\n\nI work as a fashion professional in midtown manhattan so I can come if necessary to accommodate issues. My phone is always on for text, call, and email so I will respond promptly.\n\nThe apt right off of Lexington Ave and 77 st.
