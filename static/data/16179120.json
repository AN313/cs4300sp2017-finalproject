It is a great little apartment - just what we needed.  Domingo was helpful and responded quickly to messages.  He even left us some basic food in the fridge as a welcome.  The kitchen is very minimally stocked with cooking equipment, but he did bring us a coffee maker during our stay!  Overall, it was a great place to stay. "}
