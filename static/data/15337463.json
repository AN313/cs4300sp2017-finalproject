{"description": "My place is close to BAM Harvey Theater, Barclays Center, Pratt Institute, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Fort Greene Park, Prospect Park, Brooklyn Museum. You\u2019ll love my place because of the super comfy bed and relaxing Brooklyn oasis in the midst of the city.\nThis neighborhood offers the best of downtown Brooklyn art, music, & films. Great restaurants and parks. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThis is actually a one bedroom, but I set it up as a studio space, so that the bedroom is a walk-in closet / space to store your luggage out of the way to keep the living area simple ans spacious. 3 windows offer great light.\n\nFull kitchenette, bathroom with tub, work desk, Queen size bed, walk-in closet / luggage room.\n\nI'm local and always available via cell phone or email.\n\nIn the middle of downtown Brooklyn's cultural arts hub, surrounded by things to do every night. Great outdoor spaces, parks, restaurants and night life right outside your door.\n\n4th Floor walk-up to top floor of Brownstone.", "name": "Chic & Simple Brooklyn Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4e3bc0d0-2556-4d91-a856-098319c0e246.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15337463", "id": "15337463", "price": 125, "review": "I think Johanna's place is in a great location and is the perfect size for one or two travelers.  And everything is comfortable.  For me, the challenge was that the radiator malfunctioned and led to the release of excessive amounts of steam throughout the stay, in particular at night, which made the apartment very hot.  Johanna tried her best to have this fixed but the problem persisted until my last day.  This is not to dissuade others from renting the place - it is very good value and in a great location - but just sharing my experience."}
