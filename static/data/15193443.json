{"description": "My place is close to Employees Only, Joseph Leonard, Buvette, Fat Cat, and The little owl. You\u2019ll love my place because of the high ceilings, the location, the people, and the ambiance. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.", "name": "Convenient Studio In West Village", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8f177947-7962-47e7-8ebc-c7622546deb1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15193443", "id": "15193443", "price": 150, "review": "This small studio is perfectly located in the West Village right in the middle of everything. I didn't have contact with Germaine but Eliot from MetroButler was wonderful, he even responded at midnight when I arrived to help me find the lockbox for the keys! Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a place to explore Manhattan for all that is has to offer away from the touristy hustle and bustle. "}
