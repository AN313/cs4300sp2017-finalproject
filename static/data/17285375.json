Therefore I will expect you to treat with respect.\n\n2 flat-screen tv with cable, Wi-Fi , microwaive,coffee maker, kitchen utensils and basic house needs.\n\nSomeone will be present to show the apartment if I'm not available. I can also be reached  as needed via text or phone call. I appreciate great communication so I can better serve my guests. Let me know how I can better understand your traveling needs.\n\nThere has been a lot of transformation in Harlem in the past decade with many new businesses in retail, food and entertainment jumping at the new opportunity in the area. Many people in the media, fashion and entertainment industry have moved from Midtown of Manhattan to Upper Manhattan due to cost and space. It's very safe both during the day and at night. But again I advise all my prospective guests  to be careful as this is NYC. Just as I would if I travel anywhere for vacation :)\n\n10mins to Times Square by express Train A&D, 15mins by A and D Express Train to Penn Station and Madison  Square Garden, A,B,C,D train is 3blocks away.
