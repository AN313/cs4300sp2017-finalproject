{"description": "Very nice Upper East Side studio with huge private outdoor space (on 3rd floor)! In one of the nicest neighborhoods in the city close to lots of public transportation (6, Q, & F trains + crosstown bus at end of the street). Short walking distance to central park, top restaurants, museums  and only 2 short subway stops to midtown. On the 3rd floor of a nice walkup building on a very highend UES street. This much private outdoor space is a rare find!  Great for couples or solo travelers.\n\nShort walking distance to lots of public transportation to access the whole city; 6, Q, & F subways are close by. Crosstown and downtown bus stops are at the end of the street.", "name": "Great Studio w/ Huge Private Terrace!
