{"description": "Incredibly spacious studio in the heart of the UWS (W. 70's).  High ceilings, good light, gut renovated kitchen and bath.  Very clean, and very quiet as it faces the back of the building.  Just 1 flight up.  Internet is super fast.  There is a laundromat for drop-off or while you wait 2 doors down.  Easy access to all NYC has to offer.  No pets and no smoking please.  Prefer single traveler.\n\nInteraction via text, phone, or email.\n\nThe W. 70's of Manhattan is a great neighborhood.  Clean and quiet.  Great for both singles and couples.  Right around the corner are great shops, restaurants, and markets.  The 1/2/3 subway is around the corner and will take you anywhere you need to go!", "name": "Large Gut Renovated Studio in Amazing Location", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/146a9788-9ffe-4ca8-a251-b986788481c1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16323065", "id": "16323065", "price": 110, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival.
