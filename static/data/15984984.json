{"description": "I have a very spacious apartment for you to recharge in. My place is conveniently located half a block away from the Clinton-Washington subway stop that will take you into Manhattan in less than 15 minutes. A short walk to Fort Greene Park, Fort Greene Flea market, and tons of great bars and restaurants. You will be super comfortable here!", "name": "Spacious, Trendy, and Super Comfortable Apartment!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f95f4968-c86d-407d-8499-19a54ec78441.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15984984", "id": "15984984", "price": 185, "review": "Nilu's flat is well-equipped and very neat, clean, and comfortable.  I particularly enjoyed having an elevator and being so close to the subway (1/2 block) since I went to Manhatten 3 times in 2 days.  Also I found parking less than a block away.  A great place!"}
