Just minutes from Manhattan, it is the perfect central location. You can get downtown to the Lower East Side, Upper East Side, Times Square, all in 20 minutes. There are so many amazing restaurants on Broadway, 31st Avenue and 30th avenue.  Steinway street has all the shopping you could want, with all of the major stores and boutique stores too.  All of this is just walking distance from us.  \n\nLots of large parks are nearby including the huge Astoria Park with olympic size pool, running track, and incredible views of the city with the Triboro and Queensboro bridges in the background.  Rainey Park and Socrates Sculpture Park also line the waterfront views of Manhattan.\n\nPublic transportation is so simple. \n\nA 5 minute walk to the subway, Broadway station, lines N and Q, are just 3 stops to the city.  A few blocks further walk and you can catch the R train at the Steinway stop.\n\nThe N and Q trains take you to 59th Street, Midtown Manhttan (Bloomingdale's, H&M, Victoria Secret).\n\nYou can transfer to every train from 59th Street and quickly get anywhere in Manhattan.

We have fans, heaters, air conditioners, extra blankets, everything, just ask.\n\nThis is New York City, so quarters are tight.  If you want a huge bedroom, with a grand private bathroom, you should look into a $600 a night hotel room.  The apartment is 950 square feet total, and the pictures show the space.  It is not a sprawling house in the country side.  This is compact apartment living.  Our apartment is on the medium side for New York City standards, but if you are coming from a suburban home, this apartment will feel small, so don't be surprised.", "name": "10mins to Manhattan Times Square", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bb1e659f-ede9-4040-8b39-ca98df18621a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17108395", "id": "17108395", "price": 90, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 69 days before arrival.
