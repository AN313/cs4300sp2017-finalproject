Feeding the cats was not a problem at all, sleeping in the living room was, I recommend it to couples, not three people. The communication with the host was great, I felt in security that's more than I can say for other experiences with airbnb! I would stay again for a two to three nights but not a week. It is well located, near a metro and markets. We took a chance by taking an airbnb with no pictures to start with and we were not disappointed. Overall I do recommend you stay here! \nThank you very much :)"}
