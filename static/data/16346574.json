My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nUnlike most open studio apartments, this studio features a livingroom/bedroom that is separate from the kitchen and bath area.\n\nTravelers will have full access to the studio while they stay.\n\nWhile I myself will sometimes be available, there will always be a host to meet and greet guests, give them the keys, show them the apartment, and help then any way they can (except for unforeseeable circumstances).\n\nWalking distance to coffee, breakfast, restaurants and much more.\n\nWhile there is no reserved parking, there are a few parking garages nearby.\n\nCheck-in time: After 3pm\nCheck-out time: 11am", "name": "Great studio apartment located in midtown east", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6669bddb-9f19-46bf-8a29-55ba81c4557e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16346574", "id": "16346574", "price": 110, "review": "Great experience, very cozy and clean appartment close to everything!!!
