The pictures are real. \n\nWe stayed with three people and had enough space. There was one room for each person. \n\nThe neighborhood is safe und offers a great variety of shops, restaurants and bars. \nThe subway is 5 minutes away and you have connection to the R-Train (good for lower Manhattan) and the F/G-Train (good for Midtown).  \nDon't miss Daiseys Diner on the 5th Avenue.
