What I like most about it is how hospitable and diverse the people and the small business are. A true 'Brooklyn' feel to the neighborhood! Also, it's proximity to manhattan ( 12 minutes on the A train) is really a plus!\n\nThere are bus and train stations nearby. Most efficient is the train station that is 2 blocks away (3 min walk). The A and the C line of the metro will get you anywhere you need to be in no time. The A (express) will get you into lower Manhattan in about 12 minutes.", "name": "newly renovated apt in Brooklyn!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7803afe3-961c-43ec-9fb6-0fd0cbf2f20a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16423876", "id": "16423876", "price": 200, "review": "Nice and clean apartment.
