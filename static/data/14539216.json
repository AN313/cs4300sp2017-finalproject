Went on runs along the East River, ate in varied restaurants and enjoyed sightseeing walks. The double bed was very comfy. The hot water in the shower was a tad temperamental. Having traveled from Melbourne to NYC in one day I craved sleep, which was made hard with the noise from the bar downstairs. I went in there one morning to buy a tshirt and told them I enjoyed the music and how I could here it. The person was very accommodating and said to just tell the bar staff - I declined (they've got a business to run). Nevertheless, the volume was lower for the rest of my stay there. Very well handled by them, I say. \nOtherwise, the couch is particularly uncomfortable. I would definitely stay again. "}
