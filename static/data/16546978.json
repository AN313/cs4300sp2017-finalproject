{"description": "Cozy artist loft in the heart of industrial Brooklyn. Close to hip restaurants and bars in Bushwick and East Williamsburg. I am within a 5-minute walk to the famous Roberta's.  I also live close to trains that will get you into Manhattan in under 10 minutes. \nJMZ train - 5-minute walk\nG train - 10-minute walk\nL train - 7-minute walk\n\nThe apartment is ideal for 1-2 people.  However, there is a lofted space with a mattress that can accommodate two more people.", "name": "Artist Loft in East Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/527dd73f-a086-4d82-841e-fb4f4e31c5aa.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16546978", "id": "16546978", "price": 110, "review": "Titi was a great host with clear communication throughout the stay.
