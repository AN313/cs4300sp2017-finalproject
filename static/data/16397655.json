{"description": "A spacious and quiet room atop a private home in Bedford Stuyvesant. This space is my sanctuary away from the noise of the city. Simple, minimal, and modest. Furnished with a wardrobe, twin bed, a desk, and a floor cushion for quiet reflection. There is an empty room across from this one so the entire apartment will be yours for your stay", "name": "Cozy Bed Stuy Sanctuary", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d4ce8a0d-aab6-4cf5-a6b7-1b63a4f85916.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16397655", "id": "16397655", "price": 58, "review": "Very cozy place.
