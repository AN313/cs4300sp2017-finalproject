That was very much appreciated.  His place is very convenient, a short walk to the subway (5 minutes) and a 15 minute ride to Times Square with very frequent trains at almost any hour.  The apartment is in one of those old classic buildings, I was very comfortable and had everything I needed for a cold winter week in New York on business.  The area seemed very safe, some older residential and business mixed with a new Holiday Inn and a Hilton on the walk to the subway and some nice bars and restaurants.  I'd definitely stay there again. "}
