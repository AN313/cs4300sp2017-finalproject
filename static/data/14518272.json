{"description": "Cozy and cute studio in high rise full service building just a few blocks from the E train. ONE stop out of the city. Why stay in a less than great hotel or run down walk up in the city when you can stay here! 10 minutes to 42nd street on the train. My place is close to Dutch Kills and Key Food Supermarkets. You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance, the outdoors space, the neighborhood, and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Bright Botanical Studio!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6254007b-c0d6-4df8-a49a-11ae2740d186.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14518272", "id": "14518272", "price": 175, "review": "Great place and very modern building - it is actually a decent size for a studio. Apartment is very bright, bed is very comfortable, shower is great and appliances are all high end.  There is also a games room in the building and laundry which was a real bonus.\n\nEric was excellent and very flexible - I'd highly recommend him as a host and this accommodation.\n\nThe area is fine, not much going on but a few decent bars and restaurants- it does feel safe and it's a very quick train ride (1 stop) into midtown Manhattan. You won't find anything of this quality at this price anywhere in Manhattan."}
