The apartment building and area is away from the noise and the unit is VERY quiet.  New York is a wonderful city and everyone should stay here at least once!\n\nThe West Village is the perfect neighborhood for people who like the finer things in life -- think lovely window boxes, well-curated bookshops and sophisticated company - but without the fuss or ostentation.\n\nAt a Glance\nPicture a romantic comedy set in New York City: The heroine invariably will live in a cozy walk-up on a cobblestone street in a neighborhood with cute boutiques and trendy cafes on every corner. This movie is set in the West Village. In reality, the West Village is just as picturesque. The neighborhood is tucked between Greenwich Village and the Hudson River and is one of the quietest and most sophisticated pockets of Downtown Manhattan. Primarily residential with a distinct lack of office buildings, the leafy, off-the-grid streets are peaceful during the day, but get livelier at night. That's when well-heeled residents, fashionistas and literati can all be found mingling over oysters at the area's many low-lit cocktail bars.\n\nThe Mood\nThere's a quiet beauty to the West Village and the people who frequent it. There's nothing forced or artificial about it and its loveliness is perfectly natural.\n\nBest Perk\nFrom the cobblestone streets in the morning to the Hudson River Greenway at sunset, lovely scenery surrounds the neighborhood.\n\nTransportation: \nFour NYC Metro (subway) lines are less than a 5-10 minute walk away. \n--14th Street and 7th Ave (1, 2, 3 lines). \n--14th Street and 8th Ave (A,C,E lines). \n--14th Street and 8th Ave (L line).\n--Christopher Street and Greenwich Street (PATH).\n\nUnit Features\n\u2022The Westin Heavenly\u00ae Bed \n\u2022New Frette\u00ae Hotel Classic Bedding Collection (used in most luxurious hotels around the world)\n\u2022Shampoo, fresh bath towels, hand towels, and washcloths provided\n\u2022Renovated walk-in shower with rain head\n\u2022Wireless internet with printing capabilities\n\u2022KICKER\u00ae Bluetooth Speaker -- streams music from Bluetooth-enabled devices including smartphones, tablets, or computers\n\u2022Custom upholstered furniture including love-seat, leather ottoman, and writing desk seating\n\u2022\"The Finest In the World\" custom roman shade window treatment with fabric shipped from Italy\n\u2022Keurig K-Cup\u00ae coffee maker \n\u2022Dishwasher, microwave, eating utensils, toaster, and blender \n\u2022Iron, ironing board, and blowdryer\n\u202250\" Sony Flat Screen LCD TV with Spectrum Basic and Premium channels\n\u2022Famous vintage furniture and artwork\n\u2022Individually Controlled A/C \nNOTE:  Apartment is on the 3rd Floor and is a 2-flight WALK-UP, facing Courtyard\n\nCommunity Features\n\u2022Common Garden Courtyard\n\u2022Easy Access to Public Transportation\n\u2022Citi Bike Station at your doorstep\n\u2022Near-by Public Parking Garage\n\u2022Adjacent Coffee Shop \n\u20222 Grocery Stores Nearby (D'Agostinos Grocery Store, Mrs. Green\u2019s) and 1 convenience store downstairs on the corner (Nonno Gourmet)\n\u2022Walking Distance to Hudson River Park, Whitney Museum, and Chelsea Market\n\u20223 Equinox gyms (High Line, Greenwich Ave., Printing House) all within a 10-minute walk of the apartment -- Day Passes Available\n\u2022Laundry & Dry Cleaning Pick-up & Delivery Service to the Apartment", "name": "CHIC STUDIO IN HEART OF WEST VILLAGE/MEATPACKING", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d1b5036c-9ef6-419c-8095-4648d25aa2f9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14603806", "id": "14603806", "price": 269, "review": "I simply adored Chia-Hsin's place! It's even cuter in person. Perfectly situated in the Meatpacking District - easy to access all of my favorite neighborhood spots (in the Village and Chelsea). The apartment itself was spotless, super quiet and very relaxing. Communication with Chia-Hsin was super easy, she is incredibly responsive and friendly. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! Highly recommend. "}
