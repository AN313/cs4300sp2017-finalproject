{"description": "Spacious and quiet! Great location in Astoria, only a half hour from Midtown Manhattan via subway. A 10 minute walk to the M/R train. \n\nRight on 30th Ave, home to lots of great bars and even some clubs. Only 2 blocks away from a Key Food grocery store and across the street from a laundromat.", "name": "Minutes from Midtown!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/14c366fb-f8d4-4224-b01c-ff8f02fe9aa3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17224136", "id": "17224136", "price": 110, "review": "Great place, clean and very close to the metro.
