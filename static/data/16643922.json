We felt welcome and cozy here, and it had everything we needed - comfy bed, lots of natural light, cool rooftop, the essentials and on top of that it is beautifully decorated. We enjoyed and explored the neighborhood- the place is located near so many amazing dining options, coffee shops, cool stores and the L train. Kate was very caring and wonderful, we hope to be back soon! "}
