{"description": "My apartment is a short walk to the Empire State building and all major attractions. The subway station is literally 2 minutes away & you're steps from amazing restaurants and bars. The apartment is pretty big (for NYC) and sleeps up to 6 people. There's 2 private bedrooms / 1.5 baths and a big living room area with dining table and full service kitchen. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location and the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, friends, families (with kids), and big groups.", "name": "Empire State, Large 2Bd Sleeps 6!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ae08c16e-21c6-4a33-8068-841e6895ac3a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16363490", "id": "16363490", "price": 300, "review": "Our stay at Selenne's was great. Location amazing, check in and out v easy. The apartment is a really good size too. The street the apartment is on is pretty noisy/bright so light sleepers should stay in the bedrooms rather than on sofa beds in living room. But it was fine for us. Would stay here again!"}
