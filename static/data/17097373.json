She was very sweet.. left us fresh fruit & even left us a few beers which was highly appreciated after our long day out at events. The apartment was super clean and spacious. For the most part it was quiet and peaceful except for construction going on outdoors but that's no ones fault. It didn't bother me much. \n\nThe only negatives I'd say were the fact that there wasn't a real bed and instead an air mattress. Although it was comfortable that would have been nice to know beforehand. Also, we weren't able to use the tv to watch Netflix or Hulu because there was no internet."}
