However some of the pictures she has to alter then because the couch doesn't look like the couch in the picture because theirs stains on them. She keeps all her personal clothes , undergarments and shoes inside her dressers and closets which I really didn't approve because it didn't make me get the feeling like I'm in new place ? Felt more like she was living there , really didn't like that aspect  of the place but it was a very good size and the tv is very sharp and easy to work with. "}
