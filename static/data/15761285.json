{"description": "My apartment is  5 min away from Bloomingdales, 10 min away for Central Park, 6 min walk to metro with lines 4, 5, 6, N, Q, R on 59th and 3rd, 2min away from Morton Williams, Duane Reade and many convenience stores. A twenty minute walk takes you to the MET and Guggenheim museum. The apartment is dog friendly, the only thing I am adamant about is spillage on the white couch. The couch becomes a confortable bed, the sheets and pillows are provided if you are more than 2 guests. Thank you :)", "name": "Beautiful & spacious apartment on Upper East Side", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/566b3341-0f9d-467f-8ec9-09bfc93fc57b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15761285", "id": "15761285", "price": 230, "review": "Alexandra's was an extremely charming place. Located in a beautiful neighbourhood in the Upper East side, the apartment is in a beautiful building, is extremely clean and full of character and close to great restaurants and bakeries. More importantly, Alexandra was a really good host, she was always quick to respond and welcomed us with great warmth. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to spend a magical time in New  York. "}
