{"description": "My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe apartment has its original architecture and fixtures. It is a classic pre-war New York City style.  Beautiful day and evening light. Quiet.\n\nGuest has access to the entire apartment.\n\nI have a busy schedule but will be available if necessary.\n\nThe neighborhood is designated a New York City historic landmark. A diverse area, walking distance from The Shrine - Harlem's hot Afrobeat nightclub - and other new and trendy restaurants. A true New York City / Harlem experience.\n\nOne minute walk to the A, B, C and D trains. A and D trains run express. \nAlso close to the 1 and 9 trains on Broadway. Columbia University and area trendy cafes and restaurants are about a ten minutes train ride.\n\nThe supermarket and laundromat are within two minutes walk. The neighborhood is both dynamic and peaceful.", "name": "Stay Here", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c8c5996e-167d-411d-8f9a-10bc9bff3437.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16726641", "id": "16726641", "price": 70, "review": "It was great and very close to transit and food!
