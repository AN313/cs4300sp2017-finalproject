{"description": "For more than 7 days please contact me\n\nThe apartment is well situated and closely located to United Nations, Subway station (line 6, E), 8 minute walk to Grand Central Station, and 12-15 minute walk from the upscale shopping area on 5th Avenue. The area has many cute small restaurants and bars, Morton Williams (groceries), Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, gym, 24hr pharmacy. Easy access to all the Manhattan areas.\nFree wifi, clean bath towels and bed sheets, fully stocked kitchen, ironing board/iron\n\nThe apartment is in a very quiet neighborhood on the second floor of the building. It is tastefully decorated with a minimal touch. It can ideally accommodate 3 people, but with some compromise it can easily fit a fourth person.\n\nAvailable 24/7 unless I am out of town. In most cases I will be in NYC while you stay in the apartment.\n\nVery convenient location to get anywhere in the city!", "name": "Spacious Studio - Midtown East", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9bd22464-d377-48cf-95ca-8588497c441e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17189799", "id": "17189799", "price": 200, "review": "George was a fantastic host.
