{"description": "Newly renovated 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom, Upper East Side apartment is clean, warm and cozy for your stay here in NYC. In close proximity to stores and the train, it's 10 mins away from Times Square and other major sites.\n\nClose to the subway my space is warm and welcoming. Comfortable beds and couches make it easy to feel at home. The hardwood floors and big windows keep the space feeling light and bright. The balcony provides access to fresh air (rare in NYC), space for a smoking break, and a fantastic view of the river and skyline. Times Square is 10mins away in the subway.\n\nGuests have access to everything including bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, and balcony. The building has a laundry that's also available to guests.\n\nI will be here to welcome and guide my guests. I can answer any questions and provide suggestions on activities. I will also be readily available to address any hiccups or grab supplies when necessary. Finally, through my job as a nightlife promoter, I can also provide access to some of NYC's best and most exclusive clubs for my guests.\n\nThere are countless stores and shops in walking distance. The roads are wide and rarely congested. There are restaurants and groceries and pharmacies all within a 5 minute walking radius. Subway to all tourist attractions is very close.\n\nAside from the ubiquity of yellow cabs, the subway is a less than 10 min walk away. Additionally, being located in the north of the city, driving access in and out of the city is easy and midtown traffic can be completely avoided.", "name": "Spacious, comfy 3 bedroom!
