{"description": "My place is close to Basil Pizza & Wine Bar, Branch Ofc., and the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. You\u2019ll love my place because of it's eclectic and beautiful decor, the high ceilings, the views, the location, proximity to the train, vibrant Caribbean neighborhood, one mile to popular Franklin Ave with tons of restaurants and bars. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.\n\nBuilt in 1924, this apartment is one of 80 in the building.  The moldings and floors are all original.\n\nYou'll have access to the entire apartment.\n\nI will not be on-site, however I will always leave the name and number of a friend who you may contact if you need anything.  I'll always be reachable via text and email as well!\n\nCrown Heights is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Brooklyn.  It has gone through the stages of being lush farmland to, now, hosting a vibrant Caribbean community.  Less than a mile away are incredible restaurants and bars on Franklyn Ave. It's only one train stop away! Additionally, a leisurely walk to Prospect Park is part of my Sunday routine.  It's about 20 minutes and absolutely beautiful!\n\nI'm steps from the 4 express train and the local 3 train.  About 15 mins away is the C train. All of them get you to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn very quickly.", "name": "Beautiful Crown Heights Pre-War 1 Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a0bc6ff-d63f-4668-9bae-0dcb11840549.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14330688", "id": "14330688", "price": 75, "review": "The apartment is beautiful, very comfortable, in a great location (very close to the Brooklyn Museum!), and Genevieve is prompt and thoughtful in her communication!
