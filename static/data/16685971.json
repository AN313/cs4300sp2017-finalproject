{"description": "My place is close to Midtown Manhattan 20 min subway ride to 59th Street. The subway station for the A train is literally on the corner. Safe and upscale location with plenty of bars and restaurants, parks, close to museums. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, and the people. Elevator and laundromat. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "Great 1 bedroom Apartment", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9efcf34c-9423-460f-9d97-35bb6049123d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16685971", "id": "16685971", "price": 75, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 57 days before arrival.
