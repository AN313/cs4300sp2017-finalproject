{"description": "Steps from the American Museum of Natural History and Central Park, within short walking distance of all that the gorgeous Upper West Side has to offer, and conveniently located between three subway lines.\n\nThe apartment itself occupies the ground floor and basement of a brownstone, with a small kitchen upstairs and a full bathroom on each floor. The full-sized bed is ideal for a couple, however there is plenty of space to sleep more on airbeds.", "name": "Studio Duplex in the heart of the Upper West Side", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/96cc7acc-759e-4241-9e16-4e34c4e7a2fb.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16675019", "id": "16675019", "price": 150, "review": "Nice apartment in a great neighborhood.
