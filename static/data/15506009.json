{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of the quiet neighborhood feel you get from staying here and the plethora of food options to choose from. \n\nI'm a short walk from the Nostrand Ave stop on the A train or Kingston-Throop Aves on the C. and a few stops from the Brooklyn Museum. The Brooklyn Children's museum is also a short walk away.. I live near a plethora of cafes and eateries.\n\nMy place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and small groups.\n\nIt's a extremely LARGE 1br apartment (a rare find) in Brooklyn. Roughly about 1200 Sq ft.\n\nThe entire apartment\n\nStreet parking is available although sometimes hard to get. Weekends parking is easier. Close to the Nostrand Ave stop on the A or Kingston-Throop stop on the C.", "name": "LARGE 1BR Apt 25 Mins to Manhattan", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5f8c8fcb-06dd-4073-81b8-99ff0d07d827.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15506009", "id": "15506009", "price": 99, "review": "Nice Value and great Host!"}
