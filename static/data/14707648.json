{"description": "Ideally located, Surfside Studio is an open, airy and comfortable, large studio just a block from the beach and the 97th st concessions. It has one queen bed and one queen size futon. It is also close to many restaurants like Playland Motel, Whit's End Pizza, Chicks To Go, and right next door to Surfside Bagels. There's a large public parking lot one block away, with public transportation outside the front door. Perfect relaxing place for families or couples to enjoy the beach life.", "name": "Surfside Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/034d980f-aa77-48ae-8c86-37c069a60ec9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14707648", "id": "14707648", "price": 150, "review": "Excellent accommodation"}
