{"description": "My place is close to Peter Luger Steak House and  Baby's All Right. You\u2019ll love the apartment because we have a comfy queen bed, large kitchen, living room with Apple TV, and an open backyard you can use with a picnic table and christmas lights. It is also super convenient. The apartment is right down the street from the JMZ Marcy stop and right next to the Williamsburg bridge. Only a stop away from the city (5 minutes). My place is good for couples, business travelers, and families.", "name": "Cute 1 bedroom in Williamsburg with Backyard", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7c6c5619-00c9-425b-97e5-58fc991e3ec2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14806820", "id": "14806820", "price": 150, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 85 days before arrival.
