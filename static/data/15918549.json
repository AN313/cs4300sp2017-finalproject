I am happy to help you out with any advice on the city that you need- I've been living here over ten years. :)\n\nMinimalism plus professional artist aesthetic.\n\nThe whole apartment is yours.

If not, I will also always have a surrogate on hand who is in the city and available.\n\nIt can get a little noisy and crowded in the East Village on Friday and Saturday nights.  But most people find this manageable and my apartment is quiet considering. However, if you need complete silence to sleep, this might not be a good rental match for you.",
