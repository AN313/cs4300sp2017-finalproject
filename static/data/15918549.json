{"description": "You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the comfy bed, and the light. My place is close to Veselka and Cafe Mogador- two great East Village institutions! Nicely furnished, but not overcluttered. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and furry friends (pets- dogs ok, no cats).  Free wifi and Netflix.  I am happy to help you out with any advice on the city that you need- I've been living here over ten years. :)\n\nMinimalism plus professional artist aesthetic.\n\nThe whole apartment is yours.  Feel free to use the kitchen. :)\n\nIn most cases, I will be available by phone or text.  If not, I will also always have a surrogate on hand who is in the city and available.\n\nIt can get a little noisy and crowded in the East Village on Friday and Saturday nights.  But most people find this manageable and my apartment is quiet considering. However, if you need complete silence to sleep, this might not be a good rental match for you.", "name": "1 bedroom home away from home in NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4960fe10-e900-469d-86c4-9ea05ac636a4.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15918549", "id": "15918549", "price": 238}
