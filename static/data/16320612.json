{"description": "Modern and Stylish 1 bedroom apartment 1 block from Central Park and the 110 2/3 train station! Only 11 mins from Times Square on the 2/3 train and next to great restaurants like Seasoned Vegan, Cantina 1838, Silver Moon Bakery and many more! You\u2019ll love my place because of the great natural lighting, large & modern kitchen and amazing bathroom! Secure (intercom and FOB key system) and comfortable (we actually live here).
