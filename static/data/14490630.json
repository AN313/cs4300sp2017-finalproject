Was working in Nolita for a couple weeks, and Jeremie's place was perfect. Pretty bare-bones, but clean and comfortable. If you need a place to shower and lay your head (which is exactly what I needed), a great option and great value. \r\n\r\nMy flight getting in was also delayed and I was very late getting in (2am on a Tuesday night), and Jeremie accommodated. All in all, a great experience. "}
