It's better than the pictures! The apartment is bright with lots of windows, very clean and tidy, and has everything you need for a super comfortable stay. The bed and pillows are very, very cozy! The apartment is in THE BEST location! Only one block from the water, a 5 minute walk to the Bedford Avenue Station, and it is surrounded by awesome restaurants, exercise studios, shopping, coffee shops, and grocery stores. You are right in the heart of Williamsburg when you stay at Emily's apartment. We felt like real locals! The location is fabulous too 'cuz Bedford Ave Station is the first stop into Brooklyn, so getting into Manhattan is super quick and easy! Emily was very friendly and helpful before and during our stay. She left a list of local Williamsburg spots to try ~ and we tried many ~ and everything was great! Such deeeeelicious restaurants in Williamsburg! I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Emily's apartment! "}
