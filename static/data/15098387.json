The apartment is very cosy, comfortable, clean and well maintained. Also quiet in the back part of the (lovely and also well-kept) building. Bleaker Street, W 4th Street around the corner as well as many restaurants, coffee shops and supermarket. Plus fast, direct subway ride to midtown. I was in town for business and going back to the apartment at the end of the day was a very welcome 'retreat' . Highly recommended."}
