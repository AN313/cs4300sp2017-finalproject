{"description": "My place is close to Manhattan. It is a newly renovated small studio with a brand new bathroom and a kitchenette. You\u2019ll love my place because of its convenient location (plenty of stores/restaurants nearby, and subways that will take you directly to Manhattan - all within a 5-10 minute walking distance.)  The neighborhood is safe too, making your trip home, no matter what time of day or night completely stress-free.\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14012161\n\nCozy self sufficient space with complete privacy. This place is special primarily due to its easy access to Manhattan while providing not only privacy, but also the convenience of a family oriented outdoor space.
