{"description": "Great studio apartment, spacious and perfect for a couple or a one person to getaway and to be in the trendy Williamsburg neighborhood. This is the south side of Williamsburg so it is quiet, you can still walk to everything, even the happening Bedford Ave. Two blocks from the water, great walking around and restaurants and coffee shops. The L and JMZ lines are close by! Very close to the Williamsburg Bridge to get over to lower Manhattan.\n\nThis apartment is open and there is very little noise! It is on the first floor with its own private patio. Across from a great coffee place and restaurants. There is also access to a gym in the building and laundry!\n\nJMZ - Marcy Ave stop - 10 min walk\nL - Bedford stop - 10 min walk\nUBER/LYFT to Manhattan - 10 - 20 min depending on traffic", "name": "FIRST FLOOR QUITE WLLIAMSBURG STUDIO!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6294022a-4aae-464c-ba06-444b9a19de47.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16013302", "id": "16013302", "price": 120, "review": "Cameron's place was cozy, clean and in a great location.
