{"description": "My place is located in South Harlem (SOHA) walking distance to central park west. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers or locals who just need a quick place to stay for a night or 2 . Location is perfect, close to the best restaurants in Harlem and night life has the right amount of vibe.\n\nThe best thing about my place is the open space and privacy that it comes with. The cozy feel will make you never wanna go out .\n\nI have cable and all the basic amenities that you'll need.  I trust your common sense to know what you can use or not. For instance ( you  should already know that you cant use my clothes  :) )\n\nUsually I rent my place when I'm on a business trip or away on vacation. However, if assistance is needed, I can coordinate with my guests to send someone to help.\n\nThe apartment is located on120th/8th AVE . Prime neighborhood in Harlem , south of 125th street, close to ABCD line on 116th and 125th street stops , coffee shops , restaurants and more. Safe area  for clean, responsible, single and like minded individuals.\n\nPrime neighborhood in Harlem,  You wont need to take the subway since you can walk to everything but if you must , you are 2 minutes walking distance to ABCD line on 116th and 125th street stops .
