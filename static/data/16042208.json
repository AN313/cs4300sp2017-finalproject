{"description": "Our place is close to Cafe Soleil , 43 Bar & Grill and Lucid Cafe. You\u2019ll love our place because of the location, the outdoors space, and the neighborhood. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). The 7 train (subway) is 2 minutes away and  it goes directly to Times Square, Grand Central, the High Line, Queens Museum and Mets Stadium, amongst many other cool places! If you know NYC, you are aware that this is a great location!\n\nThe space is beautiful and clean. It is a railroad structure apartment with a studio, 2 bedrooms, a great living room with cool LPs to listen to, a restroom with a bathtub and a very spacious kitchen. The view to the garden from the kitchen is lovely for those holidays' breakfasts.\n\nQueens means good food! Plenty of restaurants (and cheap) to explore. You won't regret it!\n\n7 train is two minutes away walking.\n\nWe are looking for guests who can stay minimum 10 days.", "name": "Great 2 br apartment, 15 mins from Times Square", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a747cf85-272f-4dbb-b391-459d02118473.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16042208", "id": "16042208", "price": 100, "review": "Nice place for have a different experience in ny."}
