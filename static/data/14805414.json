My loft is perfect for a variety of guests from business trips to family gatherings.\n\nVery large artist loft converted from a clothing factory. I have many unique treasures and antiques displayed in the apartment. There is one Queen sized bed that fits 2, one full sized air mattress that can fit 2, and one sofa that fits one.\n\nGuests have access to the fully equip apartment with dishes, clean linens, spices, and cooking oils. You will also have access to a large rooftop.

This vibrant waterfront community was historically a Polish area and is still peppered with family-owned bakeries, florists, and meat markets.  The neighborhood is quite fun with quality restaurants, bars, cafes and boutiques, perfect for a weekend stroll. Saturdays feature a large Farmer\u2019s Market at nearby McCarren Park. From the loft, it is a five minute walk to waterfront park named Transmitter.

Responsive hostess - the communication was clear and direct + nice recommendations of the places in the neighbourhood. Flexible check in, as we arrived late. Cool neighbourhood - mix of Polish locals  with hipsters  and everyone in between:)  Close to the train (easy connection with Manhattan), hip Williamsburg within walking distance.  And what's most important: the loft is awesome -  perfectly clean, nicely decorated and equiped! A very conveniently arranged space, kind of place I might live in myself. \r\n"}
