{"description": "Super neat 1br apartment with a large living room, 2 closets, and a large bedroom. Apt is on the 3rd floor, just two blocks from the train and 4 blocks from Central Park, and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and stores.\n\nYou'll have the entire apartment to yourself, just like having a hotel except you'll have the space to yourself and a kitchen as well as rooftop access\n\nIm not often in town but I'm always available via phone and will leave a list of recommended places for guests to see. If you have a certain event or show or place you want to go please don't hesitate to ask, I've been in the city for years and can gladly help make sure you end up where you want to be here in NY.\n\nBeautiful neighborhood, quiet, tons of street parking for those with a car, 4-5 blocks from Central Park, 10-15 minutes walk to the MET (Metropolitan Museum of Art) and a 15 min. cab to the Museum of Natural History or the MoMa.\n\nThe apartment is 2 blocks from the 6 Train stop, literally less than a 5 min walk to the train. The apartment is only 20 minutes from LGA, around 30-35 from JFK and 45-50 from Newark (EWR).", "name": "Beautiful Entire 1 Br Apt in NYC!!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9267c52e-c744-4f19-a20a-d09189647984.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14818164", "id": "14818164", "price": 175, "review": "Great place. As described. Perfect for a Manhattan getaway. Had some issues with the cable/internet not working although I don't think this was any faults of Ivan's but rather a bigger Verizon issue. Would definitely stay here again"}
