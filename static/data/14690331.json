There are literally endless things to do and see right outside the door.\n\nPatrick is reachable by e-mail or by phone whenever you have questions. \n\nAdditionally, we have some lists (via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps) of some carefully compiled lists of the area's best restaurants, cafes, and bars.\n\nThe West Village is one of the oldest and most charming neighborhoods in all of Manhattan. Its non-perpendicular streets, old paving stone roads, and 18th-19th century buildings give the neighborhood a distinctly old word feel that you will not find anywhere else in the city. But there is nothing old or tired about the West Village. In fact, the neighborhood boasts one of the city's highest concentrations of good restaurants, charming cafes, and designer fashion boutiques. Unlike the touristic bustle and chaotic rudeness of Midtown, the West Village's tree lined streets give a calming atmosphere where people love to dwell and talk to neighbors. Because of its singular nature, the West Village has attracted a large concentration of well known writers, actors, musicians and other successful artists as residents throughout the years...\n\nAs with the rest of Manhattan the best ways to get around in the West Village besides walking or biking are \u2014 Taxi, Uber and of course, the Subway. \n\nThe stations closest to the apartment are:\n\nChristopher St / Sheridan Square Station\n1, 2 trains\n\n14th St / 8th Ave Station\nA, C, E trains\nL train\n\nWest 4th St Station\nA, C, E trains\nB, D, F, M trains\n\nSince this is a personal residence (and not just a rental) there are objects of value in the house of the type that you might not encounter in a typical, full-time Air BnB rental. Please feel free to examine our books and magazines, but remember to treat these and all other objects with great care, just as if you were staying at a best friend or family member's home. Anything that it stored away in closets (e.g. suits, dresses) or filing cabinets, we kindly ask that you refrain from accessing.", "name": "Unique Designer 1BR in Best NYC Neighborhood", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/563b8243-a217-4969-84b1-e907474debc9.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14690331", "id": "14690331", "price": 280, "review": "Patrick ist ein sehr freundlicher und immer hilfsbereiter Gastgeber.
