Everywhere you look, there's a charming piece of decor, and it's a super cute and cozy place. She had maps and guides of the city available, there were fresh linens provided, basically she did a great job to make sure my friends and I felt at home while visiting ny. It's a very short walk to Sunset Park which is breathtaking, and a lot of the restaurants nearby were excellent. Even if we didn't do a lot of traveling around the city, I think we would've been pretty content hanging around her neighborhood. It was my friends' first time in the city, so I wanted to give them the best impression I could. They loved so much about our trip and I absolutely thank Lucy for helping me out with having such a fine place to stay."}
