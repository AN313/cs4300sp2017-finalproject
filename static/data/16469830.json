{"description": "Beautiful, spacious 2 (LARGE) bedroom duplex in the heart of Astoria. Great for couples, families, solo adventurers, and anywhere in between!\n\nLots of amazing restaurants, bars & shopping all within a block vicinity. Less than a 10 minute walk to the NQ subway with a 15 minute travel time to Times Square!\n\nThis is a duplex 2 level apartment which allows for privacy if you are traveling with another couple. There is a very comfortable queen sized pull out within the couch on the main living area so the apartment can actually sleep up to 4. The 2 bathrooms are located on each floor, 1 with a full bath tub shower and the downstairs with a toilet/sink. Plenty of closet space made available for guests with clean towels/sheets as well. The apartment is kept VERY clean by my boyfriend (his apartment) so would like for any guests staying, to please be respectful of that.\n\nGuests will have access to the entire apartment EXCEPT for the master bedroom (pictured) which will be kept locked.\n\nI live a few short blocks away from my boyfriend's apartment so it's very convenient for me to assist in any way. Text/call for ANY questions, I am more than happy to help! I've both hosted and been hosted by AirBNB, which is what I love about connecting with everybody from around the globe!\n\nYou are within steps of many great + diverse restaurants, bars, shopping, any necessities as well (24/7 Rite Aid just a few blocks away).\n\nThe subway is less than a 10 minute walk, which gets you to Times Square in 15 minutes, Union Square in less than 25!", "name": "Spacious 2BDR/2BATH in heart of Astoria", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2f64f259-b0de-4cdd-98f9-d455c2ce27c2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16469830", "id": "16469830", "price": 125}
