{"description": "Close to:\nFort Greene Park, Citibikes, Restaurants and Bars, Navy Yard, Steiner Studios\n\nYou\u2019ll love my place because of the size, ambiance, outdoor space, location, and proximity to the best restaurants and bars in Brooklyn  . My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).\n\nOne thing that makes this apartment stand out is the enormous (25x55') backyard.  This amount of outdoor space is unusual for New York City.\n\nIn addition to all amenities inside the apartment, guests have access to the private backyard and all amenities therein.\n\nI have little interaction with guests other than the initial key handoff.  I give my guests plenty of space and privacy.\n\nFort Greene is definitely Brooklyn's coolest neighborhood; the dining and nightlife is world class and Historic Fort Greene Park is right around the corner.  The neighborhood's proximity to Manhattan is a big draw as well; only 5 minutes by cab or car and 10 minutes by subway.\n\nThis apartment is a 15 minute walk from 3 different subway lines.", "name": "Spacious garden apartment in Fort Greene townhouse", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8b693923-2c47-44c3-a51d-7f1ad5bf4265.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15680961", "id": "15680961", "price": 150, "review": "Perfect place and very comfortable.\nJim is a perfect host.
