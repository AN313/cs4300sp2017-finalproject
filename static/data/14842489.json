{"description": "This garden level accomodation is the perfect place for people to relax in in the heart of Brooklyn's Ditmas Park. Complete with fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker, it's like your own mini hotel room in the much cooler setting of a Brooklyn neighborhood. My place is close to many eateries and bars such as The Farm on Adderley, Castello Plan, Qathra Cafe, Sycamore, Just a 8 minute walk to the F and Q trains, you're in Manhattan in 30 minutes or less. This is ideal for couples and solo travelers!\n\nWe are excited to have you! The rental space is clean, roomy, and perfect for touring around NYC. There is a comfortable double bed, a microwave, a sink for washing dishes, dishware and cutlery, a fridge, and coffee maker. If you're a coffee drinker, I'm happy to provide you with some Joe!\n\nYou will let yourself in through the white fence and then walk to the back to the private entrance to the rental space. You will have your own door to enter and exit as needed.\n\nWe will be around as we live upstairs, but do not anticipate much interaction with you, unless you need something! We will give you our cell number and you can text/call should you need to.", "name": "Garden Level- Private Entrance off Cortelyou Road", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/1e18919b-dfa7-4a9a-a4eb-8f664d722cbd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14842489", "id": "14842489", "price": 125, "review": "Tina's place is clean, spacious, and has all the amenities one needs.  Location-wise the place is near many of the nice restaurants/shops of Ditmas Park and is a quick subway ride into the city.  Tina was communicative and worked with me regarding a change in my arrival time.  Would definitely recommend!"}
