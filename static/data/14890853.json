{"description": "My cozy upper west side studio apt is located in an upscale neighborhood close to American Museum of Natural History, Central Park, Trader Joe's, and trendy shops and restaurants. The 72 street subway station is only 3 blocks away - with access to both local and express trains - and one stop to Times Square using the 2,3 express trains. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood and it is suitable for those on vacation or business trip.\n\nStaying here will give you the old-time New York experience, with a modern twist. The building was built in 1900 and is located in a prime historic location. There is a kitchenette and a wardrobe available for usage. Although bathroom space is limited, the air flow from fans and the nightly  breeze will provide a comforting sleep.", "name": "Upper West Side Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0ef572f5-cfc6-4f41-b6a0-85ed0dafa6e0.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14890853", "id": "14890853", "price": 178, "review": "Well situated and close to the subway red line.
