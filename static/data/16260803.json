{"description": "My place is close to great cafes, cool bars, express trains, delis, groceries, and parks all walking distance! I've timed my travel to various parts of the city and, from door to door, you are 30 minutes to Times Square and 30 minutes to Grand Central. 8 minutes out the door you can walk to Marshalls, Staples, Starbucks (but you've passed three good cafes :)  ), Red Rooster (awesome bar/food/vibe/Salsa night), Sylvias's (historic soul food) and many other cool little bars and bistros.\n\nThe living room is huge with a 55\" TV that has hundreds of channels, HBO and SHOWTIME. The balcony is spacious, and the light is excellent. And I rarely need it, but the heater does real work and warms the place in minutes. There is one in the bedroom and the living room.\n\nThe entire apartment is available. I'll ask you to respect my privacy, as some items will remain, but every room is yours.\n\nI won't be in tow for the majority of the stay, but my neighbors and friends are, and I'm available 24/7.\n\nHarlem is a historical neighborhood in the states which has only become safer and more diverse over the last 15-20 years. The best part to me is that any hour of the day or night you are close to a deli/bodega for that emergency box of cereal.\n\nYou are a 4-5 minute walk to the express 2/3 train which is very dependable and zips you to Times Square in 20 minutes. You are a 10-12 minute walk or shorter bus ride to the 4-5-6, an excellent line serving the east side.", "name": "Spacious, bright 1 bedroom in Harlem", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/45f61dce-9bd2-4fcb-ad96-06771b6758c1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16260803", "id": "16260803", "price": 100}
