{"description": "Beautiful Prospect Heights awaits you for fun and relaxation! Great bars, fabulous food and awesome coffee. Short walking distance to the Brooklyn Botanical gardens, Prospect Park, Barclay's Center and a ton of neighborhood gems that I look forward to sharing with you!\n\nCome rest and recharge in my comfy Brooklyn home! Large bedroom with 2 sun filled windows, a full bed with a comfy memory foam mattress, sift linens and 2 fully loaded televisions.  Living space with a full kitchen for all of your cooking needs, and a (should I say it again?) comfy seating area. Great water pressure in the shower and everything else you need for a nice holiday.\n\nThe whole shebang is yours! This is my home, so I ask that you please treat it and the other residents of my building with all the respect it deserves. The apartment is only 1 floor up, with a laundromat in the storefront and a super market directly below.\n\nYou will either be greeted by myself or my lovely boyfriend Tommy. The whole home is yours for the duration of your stay, but I am always available by phone, text or email for any questions or needs. Detailed notes about the neighborhood, food and travel will be waiting for you upon arrival.\n\nThis is my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn! Wonderful neighborhood bars, great coffee and bagels right on the corner. 2 minute access to a major super market, laundromat, bodegas, mexican, indian, thai foods and pizza!\n\n5 minute walk to the 2/3 and Q trains. The Q train is 25 minutes into Union Square and 30 to Times Square. The 2/3 runs all the way up the West side and will also take you into Times Square. \n\n20 minute $15-18 cab ride into Williamsburg.", "name": "1 bedroom + office in Prospect Heights, BK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0bb4c393-d23e-45fe-9b2b-86bda4f41e6a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15237529", "id": "15237529", "price": 128}
