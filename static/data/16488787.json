{"description": "My place is close to Buses, Trains, local restaurants and grocery stores. You\u2019ll love my place because of the location, the coziness, It's walking distance to Maimonides Hospital, Sunset park and local schools and parks. Not far from Park Slope, Bay ridge and Dyker heights. 40 minutes to down town manhattan. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets).\n\nOne queen mattress in each bedroom and a Futon in the living room. I have minimal furniture and decor so its easy to maintain and keep it uncluttered and clean. \nFresh linens and toiletries are provided. \nComplimentary bottles water, coffee and tea.\n\nI'm usually not around but I'm just a text away...\n\nWalking distance to Transit, Sunset Park and bodegas \nNearby play grounds, Asian Fusion and Pizza restaurants.\n\nClose to B70 and B11 buses and the D train\n\nAs of now No TV or cable. Wifi only.", "name": "Newly Renovated Two Bedroom one bathroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3557aea7-5819-4fed-9cf5-3d599661c9c2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16488787", "id": "16488787", "price": 90, "review": "Super.
