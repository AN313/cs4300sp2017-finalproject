We were able to walk to Times Square, Rockefeller center, the theatre district, Central Park, grand central station and Chelsea market.  It was a $20 uber ride to the Statue of Liberty cruises. Lots of shopping and eating nearby.  It's a block away from the iconic Macy's store.\n\nThe apartment is spacious, with a full kitchen and good sized bedroom.  It's between 6-8 stories up and there is a little street noise, but this is NYC.  As Marlene and others have stated in past reviews, it's not a 5-star accommodation, but it is a pretty good value for what you get in a very desirable location. Marlene was very accommodating to our travel schedule and quick to respond when we had questions.  "}
