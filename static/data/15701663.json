As Wangari wasn't in the city when we arrived, a friend of hers (Yvette, very nice) gave us the flat's keys. Wangari was also very communicative during the whole stay, and tried to think of everything so we could have a comfortable stay (providing bedding and instructions on how to get around). She also left some fresh stuff in the fridge so we could have a proper breakfast on our first morning.  The place is warm and cozy. It's also pretty modern, especially the kitchen. Thanks to the washing machine/dryer, we could clean all our clothes in no time. The flat is also very close the the A/B/C/D trains, so you can easily access any part of Manhattan (express/local). If you are looking for a nice and safe apartment to stay in order to visit Manhattan and NY in general, this is your place. Thanks a lot, Wangari!"}
