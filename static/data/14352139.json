{"description": "A beautiful and spacious apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, close to trendy Williamsburg and only one subway stop away from Manhattan!\n\nA beautiful and spacious apartment. The bedroom has large windows, which let a great deal of natural light in, a small desk and a comfy queen sized bed. A fully equipped kitchen, with all the necessities you would need to make a delicious meal! The bedroom does have an A/C unit, but the living room does not.\n\nSituated in Brooklyn's little Poland, you are close to many delicious bakeries and deli's. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance in Greenpoint, and only a short walk to the best of Williamsburg. We are located near beautiful McCarren Park. \n\nThe area is very safe!\n\nThe closest stop is Nassau Ave. on the G Line. It's about a 5 minute walk. Or you could take a nice stroll past many of Williamsburg's shops/bars/restaurants to the Bedford stop on the L Line, which would take you between 15 - 20 minutes, depending your speed!\n\nWe rent out the entire apartment when we travel, so our dates aren't the most flexible! But it's always good to check, as we do travel a fair bit. \n\nIt's a small, quiet building so no parties!\nOur friend looks after the place when we're gone, and she lives below the apartment.", "name": "Beautiful and Spacious Apt Near McCarren Park!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c842d8cc-ec57-4840-9cee-cb864fd0f0e8.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14352139", "id": "14352139", "price": 90, "review": "Rebecca is an incredible host!
