{"description": "Historic Boerum Hill neighborhood with easy access to subways (A,C,G,F,2,3,4,5). Fantastic location in proximity to the scenic waterfront, and the Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn Heights, Court St. and Smith St. commercial area's boutiques, restaurants and bars. The garden patio is good for relaxing after a day touring the city and BBQ. I travel a lot for work so I rent while I am out of town.", "name": "Private Garden Apt in Boerum Hill", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a8c5b494-1601-4f77-a929-d251e4b26a5d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17281347", "id": "17281347", "price": 149}
