{"description": "Beautiful one bedroom apartment in the heart of Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Close to plenty of restaurants, bars, and local designer boutiques. Steps away from the Mayflower speakeasy bar, and Aita restaurant. A five minute walk to Fort Green Park and 15 minute walk to Prospect Park, Clinton Hill is a beautiful, quiet, and very interesting neighborhood in Brooklyn. Perfect for couples or small groups of friends.\n\nThe apartment is a 15 minute subway ride into SoHo, in Manhattan, and two blocks away from the G and the C subway lines at Clinton/Washington Avenues.", "name": "Beatiful 1 br apartment in the \u2764\ufe0f of Clinton Hill", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/03abd7ef-3861-4080-bf4b-784e5db289c3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16242451", "id": "16242451", "price": 85, "review": "I had a great time in mariana's apartment.
