{"description": "My one bedroom apartment is within walking distance of Williamsburg and close to local restaurants such as Anella, Achilles Heel, Bakeri, and Troost. Easy transportation is also close; the apartment is two blocks from the Greenpoint G train, East River ferry, and several bus lines. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). Please enjoy the library and fully equipped kitchen, with a view of the Empire State building from the window.", "name": "Greenpoint One Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3a51e8e6-a735-490f-b5b6-c35f99e70e41.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15034827", "id": "15034827", "price": 130, "review": "Erin's place is great!
