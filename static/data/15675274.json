{"description": "This is a beautiful studio on a very quaint block.  Central Park, Museum Mile, Carl Schurz Park, great shops and restaurants are all within walking distance.  Subway and bus stops are conveniently located.  This apartment is ideal for couples and solo adventurers.  It is located on the first floor, so no long flights of stairs to climb.  It is a stylish, cozy, well-equipped apartment located in the gorgeous, sophisticated and vibrant area that is the Upper East Side.\n\nThe M15 bus runs up First Avenue and down Second Avenue.  There are crosstown buses at East 79th and East 86th Streets (M79 and M86).  There are THREE subway stops nearby.  The Q train is VERY close by at East 83rd Street and Second Avenue (less than 5-minute walk).  In just four short stops, it brings you to Times Square!  The 4/5/6 trains stop at East 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, and the 6 train also stops at 77th Street and Lexington Avenue (each is a 10-minute walk from the apartment).  One can easily hail a taxi in this neighborhood, as well.\n\nThere are three stairs (20\"H each) leading to the loft.", "name": "Beautiful Upper East Side Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/81af089e-f162-4d9e-9de8-8e02c23abdbe.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15675274", "id": "15675274", "price": 125, "review": "Tammy is a wonderful host, she's always ready to help you and she can suggest places to go! \nThe house is very pretty, small but there is everything. \nIs comfortable and near the subway (new opening January the 1st), the district is very quiet and calm not as the center! \nI suggest this place to single travelers or couples.
