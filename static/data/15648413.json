The majority of apartment buildings here were built between the turn of the century and the 1930s. \n\nFifth Avenue is entirely residential in this area except for the many cultural institutions along its 'Museum Mile,' home to the City's highest concentration of cultural institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the MoMA, Whitney, and Guggenheim museums, the Frick Collection and many smaller high-quality institutions. Also here are the elegant residential enclaves of Sutton and Beekman Place. Carnegie Hill is the City's most coveted neighborhood for families, and Yorkville toward the East River is a popular home to young professionals and singles who enjoy stunning river views and the added perk of Carl Schurz Park.\n\nCentral Park, on the western border of this area, makes a world-class front yard\u2014with its zoo, tennis courts, formal gardens, bridle paths, running tracks and reservoir. Madison Avenue\u2014possibly the world\u2019s most famous retail address and famed center of the advertising industry in the mid-20th century\u2014entices shoppers with boutiques like Chanel, Prada, Tiffany and fashion mecca Barney's New York, and a more commercial strip runs through the southeast corner, anchored by Bloomingdale\u2019s at 59th Street and Lexington/Third Avenues. \n\nWorld-class hotels in the neighborhood include the Carlyle, the Mark, the Lowell and the Plaza-Athene, and dozens of fine restaurants line side streets. Transportation includes a number of buses and Subway (runs 24/7) stations at 77th Street and Lexington Avenue (2 BLOCKS FROM the BUILDING!) as well as plenty of taxi that are running 24/7.\n\nSubway East 77th St/Lexington Ave 2 blocks away, endless number of busses 2 blocks away from the building, including taxi.\n\nNo party policy, no drugs, no pets.
