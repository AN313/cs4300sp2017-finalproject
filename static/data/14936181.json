{"description": "You\u2019ll love my apartment because of the light, the comfy beds, and the kitchen. It's a modern African experience. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nRelaxed environment in a family-owned building. Good heating, and views of neighborhood life.\n\nYou may use the kitchen to prepare meals and store items.  I will provide shelf access to store clothing in my bedroom and desk access. \n\nFresh linen and towels are available in the closet.\n\nI will be at the apartment from time to time, to sleep and check the mail.  \n\nGuests will have the entire space available for use! I will also be available for suggestions, recommendations.\n\nMy neighborhood, Bedford Stuyvesant, is spirited with longtime and young residents, local restaurants, and coffeeshops.\n\nYou have train access with the C and G that can get you to other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan within 30 minutes.", "name": "Apt with Modern Lights Available", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0520ca66-f62b-4e3f-b8b3-1160ac863879.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14936181", "id": "14936181", "price": 215, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival.
