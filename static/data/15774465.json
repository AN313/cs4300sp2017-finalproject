{"description": "Spacious 1-bedroom apartment on the border of Chelsea and the West Village, one of the best locations in the city. It's within walking distance to all the best shops, amazing restaurants and many bars. The neighborhood is extremely safe and the subway is just at the end of the street, making for an equally easy ride Uptown or to Brooklyn.", "name": "1-Bedroom - Great Location in West Village/Chelsea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/f71d68f4-1c0a-427f-99c1-652fe3f260a1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15774465", "id": "15774465", "price": 200, "review": "This was a good experience.
