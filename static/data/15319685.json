Our flight was delayed and Kris was able to accommodate our check in even though it was later than expected. Communication was fantastic, we always received a fast response and felt if we needed help/suggestions that Kris would be able to provide it for us. The bed in the apartment was very comfortable and it was nice after a long day of sightseeing to come back to the place and be able to turn the cable TV on for a couple of minutes to just unwind before bed. Couch was comfy and the kitchen was set up for all your needs. We didn't personally use the stove/oven but did use the handy dishwasher to clean breakfast bowls/glasses. Fridge was good size for storing drinks and leftovers. We were surprised how big the bathroom/shower was and it worked out great. Decent water pressure in the shower and never had an issue with hot water.\nLocation of the apartment is very good. 5-7 minute walk to a major subway station that had virtually every line to take you anywhere and the mega bus drop off is a 5 minute walk. You are within a 10 minute walk to get to MSG, Macy's, High line, Empire state building, Times Square(not during rush hour) and endless food options. We both felt very safe walking to and from the apartment late at night as well as to the Subway stations. Was also quiet at night considering you are in a major city. Only odd thing was the radiator in the bedroom couldn't be shut off so sometimes we would come back from being for 10 hours and the place would be really warm, however after consulting with Kris we opened the windows a bit and the place cooled down fast so it never became an issue. Don't know how it would be in the dead heat of summer though, but there is an Air Conditioner in the bedroom.\nOverall an awesome, clean apartment in a fantastic location. Would recommend and stay again when in NYC."}
