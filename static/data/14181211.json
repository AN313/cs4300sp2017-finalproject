{"description": "My place is close to Ditmars BLVD Subway Station , MP Taverna, Taverna Kyclades, Starbucks. You\u2019ll love my place because of It's less than a block from the subway!   It's an  actual home furnished to live in, so it feels more comfortable than a generic Airbnb place.  It also has a back terrace.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Comfy 1-Bedroom, Just a block from the Subway!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/38d01f32-c2c7-4f46-8356-315fb70db328.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14181211", "id": "14181211", "price": 120, "review": "Amazing place!!!!!
