{"description": "My place is close to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden as well as the A/C subway lines which can get you to lower Manhattan in 15 minutes. In the neighborhood you'll be down the street from great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops including Mayfield, Gueros, Barboncino, Berg'n, and Glady's. The 2/3/4/5 subway lines are within 15 minutes walking distance. You\u2019ll love the uncluttered interior, renovated kitchen, high ceilings, and quiet rear bedroom. Good for couples or solo types.\n\nThe apartment is laid out to be a comfortable and clean place to relax with friends over a meal or to simply hang out and watch a movie in the spacious living room. Modern and custom furniture pieces give the apartment a warm and unique character that's definitely easy on the eyes.\n\nYou are welcome to all the kitchen items for cooking, eating, and drinking.\n\nFor any issues whatsoever I'm only a phone call or email away if out of town. Otherwise I am happy to assist in any way I can in person.\n\nCrown Heights is a wildly diverse neighborhood with multiple personalities and characters. From the apartment you're only a couple blocks in either direction from some of the best new restaurants in the area to those that are local institutions and have been anchoring the communities there for a long time.\n\nThe A/C Nostrand subway stop is located within a 5 minute walk. The 2/3/4/5 Nostrand and Franklin stops are a 15 minute walk.", "name": "Crown Heights 1 BR w/ Style", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8b2aa4a7-82b3-4c9c-9084-fdcb58b1ebdf.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14869440", "id": "14869440", "price": 130, "review": "Landon was very helpful and accomdating.
