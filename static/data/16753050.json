Enjoy Luxury in the heart of Lower Manhattan. Centrally located by Houston Street right between the Lower East Side and the East Village & Alphabet City. Walk to Soho, Noho, Bowery, Nolita, Chinatown, Little Italy and the Villages. PERFECT LOCATION and unbeatable price.\n\nThe neighborhood is one of the most lively neighborhoods in Manhattan. Steps to \"Hell's Square\" (NY Times say this one of the most saturated areas in the city) and yet quiet at night. Steps to the East Village and its endless  bars, steps to Katz's and more. This studio is perfect for everyone who wants privacy and a top location for an unbeatable price.\n\nSubway lines are in walking distance, so basically you can be anywhere in the city within 30 minutes.\n\nThe studio has a full size bed sleeping two people and a small pull out couch that sleeps one person (or two tiny people / children). It's the ideal  space for everyone who wants to stay in a hip neighborhood and needs an absolutely private space, but does not want to pay over 400$ a night for a private hotel room.", "name": "Perfect Studio on Apartment on Houston Street", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/802b90fc-7257-477f-821d-cd7b9e6774ac.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16753050", "id": "16753050", "price": 100, "review": "Great location.
