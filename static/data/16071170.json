{"description": "Welcome to the city that has more than 1.4 million people residing in it. Just steps away from New York Botanical Gardens and right on the subway line, this spacious two bedroom gives you all that you need during your stay in the city. It's close to Fordham University and holds the rich culture the Bronx has to offer. It comfortably fits 4 people and has an elevator in the building for easy access.\n\nMy place has great amounts of sunlight which makes it very comfortable.\n\nYou have access to the entire apartment with no reservations! There's also flexibility with check-out time.\n\nMy co-host Eric will deliver the keys to you upon check in. I'm available via text and phone at all hours! Upon check out, just leave the keys on the living room table and lock the bottom lock behind you.\n\nThe accessibility to public transportation is so convenient plus it's close to Fordham University and the botanical gardens.\n\nThe B/D/4 trains are only a few blocks away which will bring you any and everywhere and when all else fails, UBER EVERYWHERE!\n\nThe apartment is an old style high-rise building. NY is also noisy so often times on the weekends the city is bustling and hustling.", "name": "Sunlight spacious TWO bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/698fd9a5-03c0-43db-b0fb-a1ec06c957db.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16071170", "id": "16071170", "price": 100, "review": "Great stay for a last minute trip and for relatively cheap.
