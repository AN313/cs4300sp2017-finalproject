{"description": "My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\nLots and lots of books. Bedroom small but cozy, queen size bed and TV (air conditioner in bedroom window in summer). Old building. Small fridge but equipped kitchen. Please note: Walk up 4 flights. Quiet and very pretty. No doorman. (PS I would rent it for the entire summer - please contact me if you are interested in a summer rental)\n\nUnique - it's pretty like being in Paris. Shabby chiq and homey.\n\nEntire apartment (it is small!) but pretty, cozy and lovely.\n\nYes- I am easily available and I have a list of recommendations.\n\nPretty, quiet. Near East End and East River and Carl Schurz Park. Walk direct to Met Museum.\n\nClose to new 2nd avenue subway and not far from 86th and 77th on 4,5 and 6 lines. Easy 79th and 86th crosstown access.\n\nJust remember that there are four flights of stairs - some people forget this when booking.", "name": "Charming Pretty one bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/53696e34-b2ab-4e04-91e8-96d6d24db65c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17252533", "id": "17252533", "price": 100, "review": "Manya's place was great.
