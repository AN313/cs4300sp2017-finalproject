Bright, very clean and cozy for our party of 5. Tony and Grace took the time to welcome us to their home and give us a tour of the space. The larger of the two bedrooms is well appointed, with beautiful tropical colors and flowers. The second, smaller bedroom was intimate, with a cute nautical theme. The couches in the living room were so comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless white and stocked with all the necessary toiletries (the shower head is perfect!). In the kitchen, Grace and Tony made a plethora of snacks, beverages and basic pantry items available to us. The neighborhood is extremely calm and quiet, and we felt safe at all times. We felt like we were in a beach house in the Caribbean in the middle of winter in NYC! Would definitely book again and again, and would highly recommend this space to anyone traveling to NYC who's looking for a great space to stay within a short ride of the other boroughs."}
