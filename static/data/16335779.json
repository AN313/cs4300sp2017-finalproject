My friend and I stayed at her home for a whole week and we had a blast! The community is very quiet and family-friendly. The train station is a short walk away and it is across the street from restaurants and fast-food places. We often walked to one of these food places, hopped on the train, and enjoyed our ride to Manhattan with a yummy snack. We felt completely safe at all times, including late at night. Yina was very kind, respectful, and accommodating. Thank you Yina for sharing your home with us!"}
