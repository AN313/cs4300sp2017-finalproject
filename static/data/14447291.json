It's like living in a luxury apartment. The place has every amenity you can think of, and even a few you wouldn't dream of (heated floors!!) Even with the close proximity to a college campus, It's still a very quiet getaway. This is the perfect place for a couple, and I would definately book again. Thanks for having us Albert!"}
