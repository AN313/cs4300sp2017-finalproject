A historic neighborhood that boasts both pristine brownstones and unkempt storefronts, generations-old Bed-Stuy residents share their streets with newcomers and hip kids.\"\nClose to these great bars, restaurants, and cafes:\nLittle Skips\nColador Cafe\nSaraghina Brooklyn\nThe Civil Service Caf\u00e9\nMetropolitan City Market\nPilar Cuban Eatery\u00a0 \nBrooklyn Kolachee Co.\nBlack Swan\nDynaco\nVilla Pancho\nBedford Hill Coffee Bar\nStonefruit Espresso - Kitchen\nParks:\nHerbert Von King Park\nGreene Acres\n\n- Right off the Myrtle - Willoughby (G) metro subway, and about a 7 minute walk to the (J) (M) (Z) metro subway Myrtle - Broadway stop. \n\n- Close to lots of local buses: B15, B38, B43, and B54.
