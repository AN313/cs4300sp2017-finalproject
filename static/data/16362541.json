Eden was very, VERY accommodating for my party.  Our  us had arrived very early in the morning but Eden let us drop our bags off earlier than check in time to lighten our load and when it was time to check out, she even let us stay a bit longer than needed so we didn't have to drag our luggage all over NYC.  The place itself was very clean and well kept.  It pretty much has everything you would need for a short stay in NY.  What I really liked was the sense of security.  You have to enter through a locked door at the building entrance before you get to her place unlike some places where anyone could simply just enter and exit as wanted.  If you need some sort of food or somewhere that gra s necessities, it is all within close proximity a traveling back and forth between the city and need her location was very simple and convenient.  Eden was an amazing host and if I make another trip to NY I would  otherwise hesitate to book with her again I available.  5 stars all around."}
