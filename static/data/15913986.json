The 1 train is 2 avenues away, giving you access to anywhere in Manhattan within minutes. The Express train starts running Local service at 11PM-5AM, meaning it stops at all stops and doesn't run express, so take a cab home as a local train will be slow and take a long time to get back home.\n\nNow continue reading for some tips on NYC- :) \nI have lived in Manhattan for many years, I am glad to help you with any questions or tips! \nTaxi from Airport, DO NOT go with the guys standing inside & outside the airport saying- \"Cab. Taxi\" These are NOT LEGIT cabs they are gypsy cabs, meaning they don't have their license or a meter so you will get OVERCHARGED! Look for the Taxi stand right outside the airport, where the yellow cabs are. Yellow cab takes cash or credit card. \nThe EASIEST way from airport is to use UBER! Download the Uber app on your smartphone & set up your account. When you land at airport and after you get your baggage, use Uber & put in my address for destination. They will pick you up in 1 min! SO EASY, CHEAP, & NICER CARS THAN TAXI!  \nCityPASS is awesome!\nBest Bus Tour to see the city - Grey Line Bus Tours \nBest Free App for subway map - NYC Subway\nBest Free App for Smart Phone for NYC- NYCWAY \nNYC is just a grid, so it's pretty easy.The higher the number the STREETS go, the more NORTH you are going. The lower the number the streets go, the more SOUTH. The AVENUES go from right to left (I remember this bc Jewish people read the Torah right to left). \nThe LOWER the AVENUE the more EAST you are going, & the HIGHER the AVENUE, the more WEST you are going :)\nThe subway has signs above the platform  & you just have to read to make sure you are going in the right direction. \nTo do sightseeing in Times Square/42nd St., for example, from the apartment, you want to take the DOWNTOWN train, the A or D Express train, so look for DOWNTOWN & the correct letter on the platform and on the train when it arrives. To come back to the apartment, you want to go UPTOWN. \nThe Express train starts running Local service at 11PM-5AM, meaning it stops at all stops and doesn't run express, so you may want to take a cab home as the Local train will be slow and take a long time to get back home. \nTimes Square best at night!\nEmpire State Building or Top Of the Rock \u2013 go an hour before sunset and stay till after dark! \nFor Broadway Show Discount Tickets, go to BroadwayBox or Theatermania online! \nStatue of Liberty-take a boat leaving from the South Street Seaport\nMuseums are best on a rainy day, so check the Weather Channel (free app) on phone! \nI look forward to hosting you in amazing NYC! :)", "name": "1 Bed 1 Bath Beautiful Apt", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/178a24fa-f05f-45be-bc31-f8b5b6037f65.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15913986", "id": "15913986", "price": 119, "review": "This is lovely and comfy refuge after a day in a big city, and it is so close to the metro station with the express lines A and D.

I wholeheartedly recommend it."}
