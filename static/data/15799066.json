Although not centrally located it is so close to 2 subway stations, one the express train to midtown and the other the local you can go anywhere on public transpotation.  We were in the city for 5 days and bought 2 unlimited subway/bus passes for a week and it was $62.00  One cab ride would have been that much.  Great place and soooo quiet and safe.  Make sure you get the entry code to get into the building.  And parking around the corner on 192nd Street is reasonable. "}
