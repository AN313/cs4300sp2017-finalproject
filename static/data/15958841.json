{"description": "Two stops to Manhattan! Quiet and quaint Brooklyn block. Easy parking.\n\nWe are on the R, N & D line. 2 Express stops to Manhattan or a short walk to shops & restaurants in Park Slope. We're close to Industry City, which hosts Brooklyn Flea + Smorgasburg Indoor Winter Market, and Bowlmor lanes . We're on a very quiet, tree lined block. The Greenwood Cemetery and Baked in Brooklyn are our favorite things to do. There is easy street parking.\n\nThis is a studio apartment with all the amenities. Good for families, adventurers, and folks who need a long term stay while getting acclimated.\n\nThe apartment has a private entrance in the front and back door access/exit to back yard. We live upstairs, so arranging meeting and access is very simple!!", "name": "Spacious Apt in South Park Slope BK", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7a30abd2-9970-4a95-a7c8-e222cd30de53.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15958841", "id": "15958841", "price": 95, "review": "You will love your stay here.  The accommodations were comfortable and the location could not have been better.  On street parking was a breeze and the neighborhood was safe and kid friendly.  I'd return to Jamin's place in a heartbeat!  The impromptu playdate with my kids and his was just the icing on the cake.  The subway was so close, as was a fabulous bakery and Green Wood Cemetery.  Jamin was responsive every step of the way.  "}
