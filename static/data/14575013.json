Convenient to subway and a lot of dining/drinking options. Apartment has all the necessities, no frills, but you will most likely be out and about the majority if your visit any way. Bring or buy earplugs if you are not used to city (EMAIL HIDDEN)fy bed and great coffee shops and breakfast places right on the same block! Check in was easy even though we got in really late and Robert was also easy to get a hold of if needed.  "}
