{"description": "This is a sunny and bright studio in the classic Upper East Side. In a single day, you can grab gourmet coffee at Birch Coffee, brunch at EastfFields, tour Museum Mile, jog along the FDR at East River Park, nap, then finish up the night with dinner and cocktails at Sfoglia all without leaving the neighborhood!\n\nWhen running around the city, you'll want to come home to peace and comfort. This studio is on the 5th floor of a pre-war walkup with no immediate nightlife - so it'll be quiet when you need it most. The studio has windows on two sides with unobstructed light from the east and north and is sunny all day. It features a large kitchen, a comforable living space, and queen-size bed. If it's your fancy, you're also welcome to play my guitar! ;)\n\nThis is the perfect spot for someone who wants to explore the city but come home to a respite! My place is close to Central Park, The Frick Collection, Jones Wood Foundry, Ladur\u00e9e, Maison Kayser, and J.G. Melon. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.\n\nOf course, though, you might want to venture out for everything else the city has to offer! Luckily, you're across the street from the crosstown bus that will drop you near all major lines of the subway.", "name": "Bright & Sunny Studio in the Upper East Side", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e966be24-2cd8-484a-b54d-6491bc81c0a6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16230905", "id": "16230905", "price": 91, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival.
