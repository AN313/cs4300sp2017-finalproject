Comfortably accommodates up 2 people, in the full sized bed, with the option of a 3rd person which would sleep on an air mattress. \nApartment is 4-min walk to the subway and 9 min walk to LIRR.\nYou\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the light, the kitchen, the space, the proximity to Manhattan and to great local eateries.\nMy place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).\n\nThe apartment is very quaint, having a very peaceful and country like feeling to it. The windows overlook a road that is very quiet, I sometimes forget I'm in New York city. My neighbors keep to themselves and make little to no noise. The space is very clean and those who will be here will be expected to do the same.\nThere is a very positive energy that flows through the space.\n\nI travel a lot with my job, if needed I will always be available to at least communicate via text/ SMS.\nMy neighbors are very quiet people. I do not bother them and they do not bother me, please respect them and do the same.\n\nThe neighborhood features street parking, you will have to read the signs to know if where you are parking is permitted. \nThe 7 trains' 52nd street stop is just a 4/5 min walk in one on direction, in the other direction, 9/11 min walk, is the 7 trains 61st street stop which also has the LIRR, Woodside stop, which takes you to 34th street Penn station in about 15/17 minutes.", "name": "...Su Casa", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/903f3103-4b96-4865-b1b4-90a2050bfa5e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17107385", "id": "17107385", "price": 75}
