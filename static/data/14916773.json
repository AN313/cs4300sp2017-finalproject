South Slope has plenty of great bars and restaurants. Feel free to bring your pet to enjoy a nice movie night on the couch, or even breakfast on the balcony. Perfect for 2/3 people.", "name": "Bright Cozy Apartment next to Prospect Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bacaad6f-2bfb-48eb-b584-7d9325f0ed2c.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14916773", "id": "14916773", "price": 140, "review": "Gracelyn was a fantastic host! While we never met in person, her communication was perfect leading up to our arrival and during our stay.\r\n\r\nEverything was exactly as described, but still exceeded our expectations. The neighborhood is very charming and a 5 min walk to the F/G train.\r\n\r\nWould HIGHLY recommend Gracelyn!"}
