{"description": "16th floor 1 bedroom apartment full of sunlight in the heart of Harlem. Views of upper Manhattan. An avenue away from the 2/3 train and about 20 minutes from Times Square and minutes from Central Park. Steps away from Harlem attractions such as The Apollo and Red Rooster. The building has a 24hr doorman and security.\n\nGreat for couple or a small group of friends.\n\nYou'll have access to the entire apartment. Just treat the space as you would your own home!\n\nThe apartment is in the heart of Harlem and walking distance from Harlem attractions like The Apollo and Red Rooster.\n\nVery easy to get around as the apartment is close to major subways.", "name": "Cozy 1 bedroom apartment minutes from Central Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b17af213-a364-4f6f-b531-6ebd9dfb1e78.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16124109", "id": "16124109", "price": 120, "review": "Shaina was a great host.
