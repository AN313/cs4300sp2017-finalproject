{"description": "My place is close to Murray's Bagels, Penelope, Dumont, Le Parisien, and The Cannibal. You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance, the comfy bed, the neighborhood, and the light. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nMy home is a professionally decorated one-bedroom nestled between NoMad and Kips Bay. Enjoy a peaceful sanctuary after a long day in the vibrant energy of the city.\n\nGuests will have access to most of my home except for closets and storage areas where I keep my personal belongings and areas that common sense would dictate one should avoid.\n\nI will not be reachable during your stay (the number on the account is virtual and is not answered), but I have a service that looks after my home while I travel. You can message them directly through Airbnb, and they will get back to you quickly. Please do not call, text, or email. All communication must be kept on Airbnb.\n\nMy neighborhood is rich in red brick apartment complexes, tasteful brownstones, and corporate comforts like Starbucks. You\u2019ll never stray far from familiarity in this manageable and convenient neighborhood. The area feels stunningly residential, even against the backdrop of New York City streets.\n\nMy home is just of the 6 train. Two stops are nearby and are easily accessible. Several bus lines are available in the area, and taxis are plentiful. Of course, you can always be a true New Yorker and use one of the many available ridesharing apps as well.", "name": "Chic 1BR with Elevator with Roof Deck!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2375b8dc-79e0-4945-9840-2a91e95ed213.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15482681", "id": "15482681", "price": 199, "review": "Besides an issue with obtaining the keys, everything was great. MetroButler (manager for this rental) was super responsive, place was clean, setup very well for the space, and in a great location. I would definitely stay here again. "}
