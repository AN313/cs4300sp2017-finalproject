It is a safe, ethnically diverse neighborhood of New York City with multiple transportation options (R, M, E, F & 7 subway lines) and quick access to Manhattan. It is a peaceful place to come home to after a crazy day touring around hectic Manhattan. Here you get easy access to Manhattan at a lower price, tons more space and a clean, quiet apartment with full kitchen. Best kept secret even among NY'ers is to hop on the subway and stay just 15 minutes out of the center and get more space and quiet for your money. Why stay in a cheap dangerous part of Manhattan or Brooklyn when you can stay in a safe neighborhood convenient to Manhattan where you can come and go at any hour without worry.\n\nRestaurants, 24 hour delis and diners, pharmacies, and pubs all within a short walking distance and a laundromat right around the corner. Watch a game or have a beer in one of Woodside's Irish Pubs, take the elevated outdoor 7 train to catch a view on your way into Manhattan, walk to the enclave of Indian shops and restaurants in Jackson Heights for an ethnic dining and shopping experience. Take the subway a stop or two and visit Astoria, Queens for Greek and Middle Eastern dining too.\n\nReflecting its longtime diverse foods and drink, the neighborhood is filled with many cultural restaurants and pubs.

Total commute time is 1+ hours. Cab service ride costs $26 before tips.\n\n- LGA airport: no easy public transportation. Cab service ride costs $26 before tips.\n\n- Manhattan: 24 hours train service to Manhattan as fast as 10minutes. The train is running every 5-15 minutes for most part of days, then every 1  hours during 11pm-4am. 8-10 minutes\u2019 WALK to train station.\n\n- Citifield baseball stadium, METS baseball, take LIRR train for 1 stop, door to door travel time is 20-30 minutes\n\n- Arthur Ashe Tennis Stadium, US Open, take LIRR train for 1 stop, door to door travel time is 20-30 minutes\n\n\n- By Train: 24 hours train service to Manhattan as fast as 20 minutes.

Bus 13 take you to downtown Flushing, the biggest Asian community in North America under 25 minutes. Bus 31 stop at the same stop and will take you to south side of Queens including air train to JFK. \n\n- By Metro Subway: 7-line is nearest subway accessible via Bus 13 first at downtown Flushing, the biggest Asian metro area in the North America. I am Chinese and so definitely can give you tips where to get best dumpling, spicy Sichuan, or elaborated Dimsum brunch. Subway E, N, R are accessible via Bus 31 first located at south part of Queens. \n\n- Car: Free street parking, no alternative parking (meaning no moving), plenty of space because there is no apartment building around. 15-30 minutes to LGA airport and JFK airport; 30-60 minutes to Manhattan. 15 minutes to downtown Flushing.\n\n- Cab, Taxi, Limousine car service by low cost Chinese cab company +(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) to LGA, $26 to JFK (or you can take Bus 31 $2.75 to AirTrain $5), $33 + toll to Manhattan/Time Square (or you can take train $8~), $15 to Flushing downtown (subway 7 line); Drivers will be very happy for additional 15% tips. Cab usually arrive to pick you up within 20 minutes during non-rush hours.\n\nCOLLEGES - This is the perfect location when visiting St. John's University, Queens College, Hofstra University, Long Island University, Adelphi University and any colleges in Manhattan, John Jay, Hunter, La Guardia, F.I.T., Bharuch and etc\u2026.\n\n- Parking: tons of street parking, FREE, because it's on a dead end street at quietest part of the town.

Rental car can also be arranged on per day or per week basis. I will leave you with the phone number of my personal favorite cab operator (cheaper than uber) to arrange the car service on your own. \n\nHost is very flexible on the guest's needs as long as an understanding is agreed upon between the host and guest is made. As a host, it's our responsibility to help you live like locals, relax in your space, or get ready for an important meeting or plan.",
