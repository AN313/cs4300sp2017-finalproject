{"description": "A spacious, cozy apartment conveniently located by Central Park, Riverside Park, Morningside Park, and St. John The Devine.  This apartment is very accessible, just 1 block from the 1 train and close to the  Cathedral Parkway Subway Station (1, B and C trains). You can get anywhere in Manhattan quickly! The area has restaurants and history galore, not to mention a 24 hour grocery store and pharmacy around the corner. We love our apartment and hope you will too!", "name": "An Oasis in the Big Apple", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/797a8af8-7421-4a51-9fb3-66185fcfbabc.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17255171", "id": "17255171", "price": 200, "review": "Very charming, clean, and spacious apartment in an interesting and diverse neighborhood.
