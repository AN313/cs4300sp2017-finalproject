Payment- You \u201csubmit a booking\u201d which means you pay the full amount now. We do not get paid until after your arrival.

Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have more pictures of the house and are unable to send you any more.\n\n4. The site blocks telephone numbers until you have booked your trip, so we are unable to call you.\n\nThanks!", "name": "Great Townhome! 1 Stop from Manhattan!!
