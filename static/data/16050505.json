{"description": "This is a bright, cozy apartment on a beautiful tree lined street in Brooklyn. Located half a block from the G train, you will be 10 minutes to Williamsburg and 20 minutes from Manhattan. You will have the entire apartment to yourself, besides the second bedroom. My roommate will also be out of town, and though his room is not available for use, you will have the apartment to yourself. In addition to a roof with sweeping views of the city, the bedroom has a private balcony.", "name": "1 Bedroom Apartment with Balcony in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/52e57975-6df0-4ce3-ab3b-45eb3cb34e47.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16050505", "id": "16050505", "price": 75, "review": "The apartment was pretty much as described. Nice clean property, elevator to floor. There is no TV... but who watches tv anyway?"}
