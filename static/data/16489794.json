{"description": "My place is right next to the Q train (400 ft from building), Prospect Park (15 min. walk), Union Square (30 mins by subway) and a block away from Cortelyou Rd. with coffee shops, restaurants, and daily essentials (grocery stores, pharmacy, laundromat, etc). You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the afternoon light, and how easy it will be to get into Manhattan. My place is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nThe space is a bedroom studio with attached living room, dinner/work table, kitchen, coffee bar, and bathroom.\n\n This is a home that respects all backgrounds-regardless of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age--without judgment or bias. My main concern is to provide you with the feeling of being home. Your comfort, safety, and happiness in my apartment is the utmost importance to me and I will do everything I can to ensure you feel like you are staying with a good friend in NYC.\n* Please* treat my home as if it were yours; with love and respect. :)", "name": "Cozy-chic Prospect Park charmer.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a4a0f76a-d499-4d0a-a5fb-5205673e2716.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16489794", "id": "16489794", "price": 100, "review": "The aparment is a nice place to stay in New York.
