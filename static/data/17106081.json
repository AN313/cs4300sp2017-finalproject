It was calm and peaceful, the patio access is beautiful the layout of the apartment is great. Lots of bars, markets, dry cleaners, restaurants etc. 10 mins walk to grand central (a major subway stop).. close to highway so driving around to different parts of the city was great. Jared is definitely a great amicable individual. I highly recommend his place for anyone visiting this wonderful city! "}
