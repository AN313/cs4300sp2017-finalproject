{"description": "This spacious apartment (1050 sqft) located at the neighborhood of Bushwick in Brooklyn, a great neighborhood with a lot of cultures and histories. The location is great, only 3-5 mins walk to the Subway Station (J&Z Train-Brooklyn \"Gates Ave.\"), about 15-20 mins to lower Manhattan. Surrounded with many restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets and shopping malls. A good choice for a short trip to explore New York City and experience the tremendous artistic temperament of Brooklyn.", "name": "Newly Renovated 2 bedroom apartment in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cc57fc62-a952-4d0c-be20-aa707f092c31.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16636519", "id": "16636519", "price": 119, "review": "Enjoyed our stay.
