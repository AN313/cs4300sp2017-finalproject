{"description": "Our place is 15 minutes to Williamsburg, 20 minutes to Union Square in Manhattan. You\u2019ll love our place because it is close to the subway, modern, clean, newly renovated and located in happening Bushwick. It's on a quiet, tree-lined street where you can find parking if needed.  Our place is good for couples and solo adventurers.   There is a very comfortable queen-sized bed, and a comfortable couch that can turn into a full size bed that sleeps 2 if necessary.\n\nThis is a spacious, renovated studio in the basement of a brownstone.\n\nYou have your own separate entrance to the basement studio.  It's completely private with a private entrance.  We would never enter without telling you first and without as much advance notice as possible. We would only enter if we need to access the utility room -- which is rare.\n\nYou can always text or call if you have any questions, need anything, or need any recommendations.\n\nOur street is quiet but we are minutes away from galleries, unique bars, restaurants and clubs in a trendy and up-and-coming neighborhood.  Check out the Guidebook: we have recommended a number of places that are all within 20 minutes walking distance or less, and 10 minutes or less on the subway.\n\nWe are a 5 minute walk from the Myrtle - Wycoff stop on the L and M subway lines.\n\nWe have a French press and an Italian (Bialetti) coffee makers, and single-cup manual drip filter, - but no drip machine. We have basic kitchen tools and supply pantry staples such as salt, pepper, sugar.", "name": "Newly renovated studio in hip Bushwick near subway", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/234966c8-0d8f-495c-8a3f-bc2e0e77d6ad.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14234561", "id": "14234561", "price": 85, "review": "Perfect and easy communication, nicely furnished and clean apartment, close to the subway and supermarkets, good travel guide/recommendations.
