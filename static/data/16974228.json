He is always reachable via text or phone, and is the friendliest and most responsible host I have ever had. \nOne night, my girlfriend and I locked ourselves out by accident, but Rafael was a phone call away and we got back in within an hour! AND it was Friday at midnight. The place was very tidy and well supplied, with everything from kitchen supplies to toiletries and towels. It was the perfect get away for me and my girlfriend, quiet at night but also close to lots of restaurants, and not to mention both the 6 and WQ lines (amazing!).",
