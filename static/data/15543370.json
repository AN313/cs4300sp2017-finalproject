{"description": "My studio apartment is in the heart of the Chelsea/ Meatpacking neighborhoods.  Highlights of the area include the High Line, the Whitney Museum of Art, tons of amazing bars and restaurants and the a/c/e subway line! It's incredibly convenient and steps from any shopping, nightlife, dining, or otherwise, that one could do in NYC!\n\nThe space will be extremely clean and tidy upon your arrival\n\nKeys will be left inside the apartment!\n\nI am always available!  I am super communicative and always available for recommendations too!\n\nThe meatpacking district is home to some of the best dining, nightlife, and entertainment in NYC, while still maintaining a small neighborhood vibe.  There's tons to do within walking distance!\n\nThe A/C/E and L is on the block and the 1/2/3 is just one avenue away!", "name": "Studio Apartment in Chelsea", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8ff5e4f8-6689-46d7-be53-f170cc139a56.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15543370", "id": "15543370", "price": 170, "review": "The 2 of us had a great time in Meredith's apartment last week.  It's definitely on the small side, but manageable. She provided towels and had some great suggestions for places to check out in the area...just ask! \n\nWe never quite figured how the heater/ac works but we were comfortable with the temp in the room for the most part. \n\nIt was very close to the subway, Chelsea market,  and the high line. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "}
