{"description": "My place is very close to Central Park, only 3 blocks away. You will be next to the best shops in the world, and many of the best restaurants. There is also big supermarket right across the street. You will not find a studio apartment with a better location than this. The subway is a few minutes walk, 5 blocks to the 6 train. You\u2019ll love my place because of the beautiful windows that overlook a garden. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Charming Studio in the Heart of it All!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ebf05fa3-47c3-49f4-bf1d-52fe6c9e3c72.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15311845", "id": "15311845", "price": 161, "review": "Perfect location - perfect for 2 guests.
