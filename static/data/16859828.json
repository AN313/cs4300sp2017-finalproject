{"description": "Very spacious and cozy 2 bedroom apartment in Washington Heights.  Lots of natural light, a full kitchen, laundry in the building, parking on the street, and a 5 minute walk from the train  - just 35 minutes away from Time Square! We live here with our tuxedo cat, Figaro (that will be taken care of during your stay). This is a great spot for you, if you are looking for a quiet spot during your trip to Manhattan.  Included with your stay is a bottle of red, and a fresh baked loaf of sour dough.\n\nOur apartment is a 5 floor walk up. There is one full sized mattress and one queen, as well as an air mattress for additional guests.  You can have access to all of our kitchen appliances.  We will provide towels, clean sheets, and lots of feather pillows :)\n\nYou can have access to the whole apartment including both bedrooms, living room, and kitchen.\n\nDuring your stay, we will be out of town.  However, we can be reached by phone or text anytime of the day.  There will be someone who will come by to take care of the cat, and if you have any immediate issues - they can assist.\n\nWe live on a very quiet street in Washington Heights.  It is a very safe area, with a lot to offer.  Its very close to beautiful Fort Tryon park, and the Cloisters.  Just a 10 minute walk to some excellent coffee shops, quaint restaurants, and wine stores.  It doesn't feel like you are in Manhattan- which can be very nice at times.\n\nWe are a 5 minute walk from a train that takes you straight downtown.", "name": "Beautiful two bedroom in Washington Heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/259cbe50-a59b-429e-be1c-b0587699ff29.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16859828", "id": "16859828", "price": 95}
