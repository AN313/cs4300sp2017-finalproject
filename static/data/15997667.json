Great location for our visit to explore the Upper West Side of New York!  Lots of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and bars to suit all tastes!  Hosts were very responsive to emails prior to our arrival and I did not need to reach out during our stay as all went smoothly.   Apartment on the 5th floor and no elevator so keep this in mind if stairs are a problem.  Otherwise, nice place to rest at the end of your day in the city.  "}
