We had all the information and he stayed in touch before and during our stay. The location however didn't feel super safe, nor was it close to niceties you associate with New York. After talking with our drivers, I realized that the price was twice what it should be for the size, condition, and location. But, if the location is good for you and you have 3 people sharing the space (one on the couch), it may work out. There IS a strange smell in the living area---may be the couch leather or litter box outside the door--not sure. Otherwise, it was private, and orderly."}
