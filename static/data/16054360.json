{"description": "Located on the new and upcoming Bedford Heights along Bedford Avenue, en blanc is a building as versatile as your lifestyle. It is a getaway that offers every convenient right outside your door. \n\nEnblanc is juts a few blocks from an Organic Supermarket, the Barclays Center, the Bedford YMCA as well as the celebrated restaurants, bars, and boutiques of charming Bedford & Nostrand Ave. in Bedford Stuyvesant.\n\nVery quaint space featuring a small kithchen, laundry facilities and comfortable bathroom. Rooftop access is available (via separate reservation after check in).\n\nGuest have full access to 1 apartment floor,  and a rooftop deck with reservation\n\nGuests will see me or Sasha upon arrival for an orientation of the apartment. I will be a phone call or text away if need be after our initial interaction.\n\nThe diversity of nationalities in Bedford Heights is definitely one of the main characteristics that I enjoy about the neighborhood. \n\nNot forgetting a range of restaurants, bars, supermarkets all within walking distance and this spans within a 2 mile radius. Clubs, Lounges, karaoke bars to name a few.\n\nUber, Green Taxi cabs are only a finger wave away outside the entrance to the apartment. However, the A/C train to and from Manhattan in about 2 blocks away at the Franklin Avenue Station. A single metro ride is $2.75 per person. It would be economical to purchase an unlimited metro card for $31.00 if you intend on riding the subway very often during your stay.", "name": "Blanc Bedding on Bedford Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e3c5e314-e7f3-4c5e-99c6-42a3bf319827.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16054360", "id": "16054360", "price": 125, "review": "A great place"}
