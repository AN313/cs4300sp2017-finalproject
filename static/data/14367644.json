The host was so accommodating and polite, I couldn't have imagined a more perfect stay. The house is SO lovely and the perfect image of \"Brooklyn\" - seriously phenomenal. A bar and coffee house are right downstairs, the whole block has the cutest places to eat and just a small walk away from really cool shops. Not to mention the VIEW! Can not wait to come again!!!"}
