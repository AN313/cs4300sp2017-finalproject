It's a simple rental -- a place to stay at the end of the day, located near good bars, cafes and restaurants as well as transportation. In the warmer months you could get some use out of the private terrace. Very nice. \n\nWe had some trouble with the wifi because the password on the router is not as self evident as we were told it would be. Once we were on the network the wifi was great. The only other issue was that there was no trash bin ANYWHERE so we had to get creative. \n\nJake was communicative and helpful. Overall I'd be happy to stay there again. "}
