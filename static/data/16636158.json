It was comfortable and cozy and nicely furnished. It's on the fifth floor at the top of the stairs so you get plenty of exercise. It's close by to a subway and within walking distance of a bunch of great restaurants. \n\nI didn't see anywhere to adjust the heat so we had to have the window open most of the time. "}
