She described the apartment exactly as it was-  and there were no surprises (which was great!) The building was central to where I needed to be and the apartment was very clean. It was a 5th floor walk up which was fine for us and I appreciated that she kept in touch regarding check in times. I would absolutely stay here again!"}
