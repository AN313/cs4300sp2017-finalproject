{"description": "A straight shot on the A train from JFK, my place is like a cottage within the neighbourhood of Brooklyn's BedStuy. Enjoy the delicious Southern cooking of surrounding restaurants, as well as beautiful walks along tree-lined streets. A great community and exciting part of Brooklyn. My place will provide the excitement of New York without the craziness of Manhattan. Easy commute into the city on A or 3 train, my place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Enjoy!", "name": "Private room in cozy Brooklyn BedStuy", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/51b6c3ae-305b-47ba-886f-f3392aaef15d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15232047", "id": "15232047", "price": 45, "review": "Molly's home was just as described. For someone looking to stay in the city on a budget this is a great option. Location next to the subway made access to the city convenient. Molly was easy to reach in very responsive to our questions throughout our stay. "}
