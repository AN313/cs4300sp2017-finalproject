{"description": "Urban elegance in the heart of Crown Heights. \n\nEnjoy a spacious one bedroom with stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, and a breath-taking view of Manhattan. Steps away from Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Museum, and the 2/3 and 4/5 trains to get you into the city in no time.\n\nHome to many of Brooklyn\u2019s museums and boasting the influence of a strong Caribbean community, Crown Heights adds a dash of spice to Brooklyn\u2019s varied mix of neighborhoods. Although Crown Heights merits its somewhat seedy, rough and tumble reputation, its wholesome and highly anticipated street carnivals cultivate sincere neighborliness. The neighborhood's small businesses continue to infuse its streets with vigor, as Crown Heights sheds its less-than-glamorous past.", "name": "Urban Elegance in Crown Heights", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/82443045-706a-4614-8057-02a02a39c24d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17106644", "id": "17106644", "price": 110, "review": "The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.
