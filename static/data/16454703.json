What this means to you is a classic NYC \u2018melting pot\u2019 neighborhood with TONS of great places to eat.  There is a cafe, diner, Italian bakery, pizzeria, deli, grocery store, bank, laundromat, park, library, and post office within three blocks from the residence.

It is a 3 minute walk to the R-train 95th street station.  \n\nIf you like shopping, you will love the shopping district on 86th Street where you can find Century 21, The Gap, TJ Maxx, Banana Republic, The Children's Place, New York & Company, Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret  and more.\n\nWhen you want a break or some exercise, the Shore Road Park and Bay Ridge Promenade are the places to go. Enjoy a run by the water with views of the Verrazano Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and Lower Manhattan. Slow down and walk over to Owl's Head Park, Narrows Botanical Garden, and the American Veterans Memorial Pier. Here you can watch the ferries on the water and the helicopters in the sky as local fisherman try to hook their catch of the day!\n\nWalking and subway are best. Buses are nearby. Cars... well, you know, it's New York.", "name": "Spacious Brooklyn, New York Retreat", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fe21065b-9a3c-45af-9d3c-43338469f0b3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16454703", "id": "16454703", "price": 185, "review": "My wife and 17-year-old son and I stayed at J's place for 4 nights, and we all loved it. The subway is right at the end of the block. We found several tasty places to eat within easy walking distance. J was a thoughtful and very helpful host.  We hope to stay here again the next time we visit NYC."}
