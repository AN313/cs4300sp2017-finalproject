Todd & Ashta's place was great and accommodated 4 people comfortably. It is right next to the train station that takes you straight into Manhattan. The place was clean and we were provided all the amenities we required. They even had board games, which were fun on a rainy night in Brooklyn.  Todd & Ashta were very responsive to my texts and provided great suggestions for the neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here for my next trip to New York. "}
