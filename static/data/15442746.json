{"description": "Very easy check-in/out process with Key Cafe.  Entire apartment is yours.  Perfectly situated in the heart of the West Village - my place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nAmazing west village located. Located on the ground floor, so some slight street noise but can't be the area and the atmosphere.\n\nEntire apartment\n\nI travel in and out of NYC, but have services nearby that can help accommodate special requests\n\nWest Village is the best neighnorhood in Manhattan - wonderful food, celebrity sitings, gorgeous buildings and neighborhoods.  Once of the most amazing places in the world no matter the time of year.\n\nThe W4th Subway stop is a few blocks away.   It has the following Subway lines: A,C,E, B, D, F, M\n\nThe Christopher Street stop is also very close for the 1,2,3 lines.\n\nThe place is all yours.

Perfect if you plan to. be out in the city and just need a bed and bathroom. The small kitchenette is perfect for preparing snacks, with a fridge to keep things cold. a fair bit of street noise but that's the price you pay for a super-central location. "}
