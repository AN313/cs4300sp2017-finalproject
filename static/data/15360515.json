{"description": "Our small, but cozy apartment, could not be more conveniently located. It is 2 blocks from the ACE and 1 lines and a quick walk to the NQR, BDF, and J. 1 Full Size BR with a lofted FULL size bed in living room and a comfy couch underneath. Feel free to use the espresso machine!", "name": "Cozy 1BR Apartment in Heart of Soho", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cd7aecd3-0e8e-42fd-9d8d-159d19ba61d1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15360515", "id": "15360515", "price": 158, "review": "My friends and I checked into Carlo's place on a freezing rainy day in the city and thought the location was perfect for grabbing dinner and essentials in the area. Check-in was much easier than prior air bnb experiences in NYC because we were able to pick up the keys at an establishment open 24/7 less than a block away. The beds and couch were super comfy, we really enjoyed the decorations in the apartment, and we liked being able to connect to the TV to play music! One or a few extra pillows would have been nice. It was overall an excellent experience."}
