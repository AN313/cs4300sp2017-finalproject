{"description": "Hey everyone my name is Manuel and I am a traveling physician however I call NYC home. My place is super cozy and I have an enormous outdoor private patio. I do live above a bar so it is noisy so if you are a light sleeper than please look elsewhere. Depending upon the day the music at the bar goes off around 11 - 1am. Since I am new to Airbnb looking for people who have a few reviews and people who are mellow! Check out the pictures and hopefully we can work something out!\n\nLarge living room great for entertaining which opens up into the kitchen. Private patio is large and l installed some patio lights out there so its great to have a beer and a smoke. I have a nice workspace with a big desk if you are trying to get some work done while traveling.\n\nEntire space is available\n\nAsk any questions in regards to bars / restaurants / shopping....\n\nI live in the upper east side. There are a lot of good bars / restaurants. Central park is only 4 avenues away\n\nClosest train station is 86 street and lexington ave\n\nI live above a bar so it is loud if your a light sleeper I would think about staying elsewhere", "name": "Upper east side apartment with  private patio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e5a9e220-33d8-4dfa-99cd-097736e6e7c5.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16110097", "id": "16110097", "price": 300, "review": "Everything was very easy starting with getting keys from a key cafe by the apartment at our convenience.
