{"description": "My place is in Williamsburg - one of the hippest neighborhoods of NYC. Located two blocks from the L-train, you can get to Union Square in 15 mins. The house is walking distance from the best restaurants and bars, Nitehawk Cinema, waterfront with NYC skyline views, Artists & Flea Market + tons of great coffee and brunch places. You\u2019ll love the well-lit home with a super comfy bed (+ sofa bed), and a full kitchen. Good for couples, friends, solo and business travelers, and families (with kids).", "name": "Sunny Williamsburg Apartment-15 min from Union Sq.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/80b19571-f3ce-453a-aa50-0dcd1efee823.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16363498", "id": "16363498", "price": 120, "review": "Shachi was an incredible host.
