Super close to public transit and eating locations. Overall experience was great but this AirBnB isn't for everyone. It is clear that this is one of Max's primary residences as it has a very \"lived in\" feel and look. If you are adventurous, eccentric and open minded I would suggest this location as an awesome choice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
