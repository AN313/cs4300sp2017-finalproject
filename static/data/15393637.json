The place is quite large and during some portion of the year, my partner, Jean will be staying on a day bed in the Great Room.  While he is there drapes will be drawn to create a private space for a small sleeping area within the Great Room.\n\nSpanish Harlem is famous for its Uptown Funk, diversity, affordability, access to the rest of the City.  This location has all that and more as the apartment is on the same block as a 6 Train Subway Station.  Bodegos and Delis on three of the four corners and a collection of convenient food options one block east and you can experience the 21st Century Harlem Renaissance with a wide array of foddie choices and entertainment venues, including the historic Apollo Theater in minutes.\n\n6 Train is essentially right outside the door of the building \n2/3 Trains a few blocks away \nM(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) southbound at the corner, northbound one block away\nM106 four (4) blocks\nGreen and Yellow Cabs to hail at the corner\nM60-SBS to LaGuardia Airport \u2013 35 minutes", "name": "Uptown NEVER Felt so in the Middle of Everything", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6a7d6674-b20a-4297-bbc1-771775ae0856.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15393637", "id": "15393637", "price": 150, "review": "Jay was a very nice and available host. We loved being close to the subway for easy access to the rest of the city. The only issue we had was with wifi access. The access point must be pretty far away because we had a lot of trouble accessing it and when we did, it was slow. Otherwise, this was a great place to stay and I would absolutely recommend it."}
