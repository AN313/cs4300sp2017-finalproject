{"description": "My place is close to Subway stop (6 train), Bus Stop (M15), Bars/Restaurants, Central Park, Museum Miles (Frick Collection, Metropolitan, Guggenheim).. You\u2019ll love my place because of the coziness, the comfy bed, strategic location. My place is good for couples, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\nYou have the kitchen, the living room, bedroom and bathroom available just for you! Internet connection, hot water, A/C are available too!\n\nThe guests will be able to use the full apartment. Included the kitchen of course!\n\nEither me or a trusty person will be available for any help you may need.\n\nYou are in the lower part of the Upper East Side, few blocks from Central Park or the East River, and close to the main museums of the cities. Bars and Restaurant are nearby the house. I can recommend some of them.\n\nThe 6 train will bring you quickly wherever you need to go in the city. Of course, you might need some train change if you want to go far! Also cabs rides are pretty cheap for reaching the place from the main areas of the city!", "name": "Cozy 1 bedroom in the Upper East Side, NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d5da9bc2-efec-45e1-b838-c0f994a855d7.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14980174", "id": "14980174", "price": 220, "review": "I wish I could give this place ten stars! It was so perfect for our trip. Great location, clean, and super affordable for the area. Metro station was two blocks away, parking garage right across the street, really close to some shopping and Walgreens, and a laundromat right next door. Ciro was not here but he had his friend show us everything and was super helpful throughout the whole process. Loved it! "}
