It's in the center of everything but still quiet. The size of the apartment is large for NYC and we had everything we needed. The host was very communicative and provided Wifi along with other helpful details about the place before we got there. Make sure you know where and how to obtain the keys before you arrive as that was the only confusing part of my stay. Would stay there again!"}
