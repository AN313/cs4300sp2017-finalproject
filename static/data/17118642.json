{"description": "Great for couples and solo adventurers. Literally on the border of trendy Bushwick and steps from both the L and the M trains, it's convenient for spending time in Brooklyn and only 20 minutes to Union Square, Manhattan. \n\nBushwick offers a robust art scene, great dining options and street art galore. Not to mention the many offerings of near by Manhattan.\n\nThe apartment has a spacious, sunny living area, new bathroom and kitchen, with dishwasher.\n\nThere is an unfinished roof deck that is worth a look. The 360 views of the Manhattan skyline, all of Brooklyn and Queens is amazing.\n\nI will be close by in New York City.\n\nOne block from both the L & the M trains. Bus depot to all areas of Brooklyn also one block away.", "name": "Bright, sunny, modern one bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/61bbaa2e-45cf-4269-ac41-eb687f349a3a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17118642", "id": "17118642", "price": 60}
