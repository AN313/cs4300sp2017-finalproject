{"description": "My place is close to Flushing Meadows Park, Citifield, USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Laguardia & JFK Airports. You\u2019ll love my place because of the warm decor, the ambiance, the outdoor space, and the proximity to Flushing Meadows Park (Home of the 1964 World's Fair). The parking is pretty plentiful. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.\n\nFlushing Meadows Corona Park\n\nCitiField - Home of the NY Mets\n\nNew York Hall of Science\n\nQueens Museum\n\nBillie Jean King National Tennis Center\n\nForest Hills Stadium", "name": "Beautiful Garden Townhouse Apt, Close to Parks.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/99046411-ed4f-4c53-922c-b04e72492d24.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15819031", "id": "15819031", "price": 105, "review": "Matthew gave us a heartly welcome at arrival and he was always reachable if we had any questions.\r\n\r\nThe apartment has a high living standard, everything nice and clean.
