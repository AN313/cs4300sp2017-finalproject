{"description": "Located in one of the most charming neighborhoods in NYC.  Broadway shopping is just blocks away. You\u2019ll love my place because of the neighborhood, convenience (numerous subways and bridges) and  the street view. \n\nPlease note the title of this listing \"Camping in Nolita.\" \nWe have moved out of this apartment but, stocked it with the necessities as listed. Because of this you are able to have access to a super clean and cute studio one flight up, street facing, and at a discount price.", "name": "Camping in Nolita", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4dba3420-a84b-447a-a253-6d296bedd38a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15175161", "id": "15175161", "price": 124, "review": "good"}
