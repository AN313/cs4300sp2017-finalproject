{"description": "Perfect for spending the holiday in the city!! This is a spacious 1.5 bedroom. The second bedroom we use as a book/instrument room (feel free to play the guitars!) but has space for our super comfy full size air mattress. The bedroom has a queen size bed! Huge living room and kitchen :) We are in Ridgewood, right on the border of Bushwick. Take the M or the L and be in Manhattan in 25 minutes!\n\nThere is so much space, and it is so, so cozy!!! A perfect little quiet home to come back to after exploring the city. We have a big flat screen with Netflix and some PS4 games for chilling on the couch. This place is perfect for 2-4 people if you are traveling with a group of friends to NYC!\n\nWifi, towels, sheets, TV and Netflix, PS4 games, coffee pot\n\nI'm available if you have any questions! Also my friend who lives in the neighborhood will be available to help out with anything!\n\nIt is so quiet and friendly! Very different from the hustle and bustle of the city. So nice to come back to after spending the day in Manhattan!\n\nThe M train is a 5 minute walk and the L train is a ten minute walk! Both take you straight into the city in about 25 minutes!\n\nGreat liquor store three blocks away :)", "name": "Spacious, cozy, quiet 1.5 bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5e1ca906-6ea7-4685-87a0-ec79adc6463e.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16332242", "id": "16332242", "price": 119, "review": "Audrey was an awesome host for us. she is very kind and flexible. we stayed at her house during our Christmas and new year trip. she was very responsive to the messages and questions we had. she was also making sure we have good time in the city.
