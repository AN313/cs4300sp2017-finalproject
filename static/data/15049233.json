{"description": "My place is across the street from Fort Greene Park, and gets beautiful light.  It is surrounded by amazing restaurants, bars, and grocery stores.  Every Saturday there is a year-long farmer's market on my street.  The apartment is walking distance from the 2,3,4,5,B,Q,C,D,N, and Long Island RailRoad.  It is also walking distance from BAM where you can see the opera, ballet, live music, comedy, and movies.  . My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.", "name": "1BD on the park!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44a17402-135a-4819-801a-e5617b3e472b.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15049233", "id": "15049233", "price": 150, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival.
