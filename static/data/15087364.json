It's super quiet and peaceful. Luis was proactive in making sure our needs were fully met. Everything is new construction with new finishes as it is located in a reviving part of Brooklyn (Bushwick).  Easy walk to local delis, grocery and bars.  Great value for locating just a few miles from the heart of NYC via the subway and saving a LOT of $$$. "}
