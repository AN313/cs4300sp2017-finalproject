For Jon's apartment the answer is YES! It is amazing, the pictures are accurate, the apartment is fully stocked with everything you would need.  From check in to the apartment itself everything was all that we could ask for and more.  Jon met us at check in and was incredibly helpful and even took the time to give us advice on the best restaurants to try around Staten Island.  He was always available and responded quickly if we needed help or had any questions.  There is plenty of parking on the street and the neighborhood is very quiet and safe.  A train and bus station are both within walking distance from the apartment and you can easily get into Manhattan!  The apartment itself was perfect and clean with everything you could ever need from linens to pots and pans!  Coupled with a wonderful host, the apartment truly felt like a \"home away from home\" and I would definitely recommend staying at Jon's place!"}
