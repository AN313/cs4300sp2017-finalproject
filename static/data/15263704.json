Vogue called it the seventh hippest neighborhood on the planet - read on:\n\n BUSHWICK / NEW YORK CITY / U.S. \nAs far as buzz goes, few neighborhoods garner as much attention\u2014globally\u2014as Bushwick.

Pop-up late-nights, an eatery in a defunct gas station\u2014check out the recently opened Montana\u2019s Trailhouse\u2014and a vinyl-recycling jewelry label called Wrecords By Monkey are all within a few blocks.

Walking distance from the L train johanna was most helpful heading us the right direction on where to eat, what to see.The apartment has everything you need and high quality bedding. It was cold while we were in new York but the heater made the apartment warm and inviting. I unfortunately became ill whilst in new York, Johanna put us in contact with a home doctors service, and changed our linen and towels free of charge- bless her. would like to mention it can be a noisy building with late night music, but nothing earplugs cannot fix. This accommodation might not suit guests with mobility issues as two flights of stairs need to be climbed. Plus plus for me was the yoga and pilates studio in the same building and \"Kave\" expresso serves the best almond latte I have ever had. You will love your trip to this accommodation."}
