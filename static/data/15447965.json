{"description": "Our beautiful, recently renovated 3 bedrooms apartment in Brooklyn is perfect for couples, solo adventurers, and families with kids. \n\nWe are on the top floor of a 2 floor building, which means that we get lots of light from windows on all sides of the apartment, as well as from skylights in the living & bathroom.

There is also a couch in the living room that is very comfortable to sleep on.\n\nYou will have full access to the whole apartment - 3 bedrooms, kitchen, living room and bathroom.\n\nWe are very close to the Nostrand Ave Long Island Rail Road stop, as well as the A, C & G subway lines.", "name": "Beautiful, Open 3 Bedroom Apartment in Brooklyn", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/879693e6-77f9-4d74-a6e5-e9a2425168a6.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15447965", "id": "15447965", "price": 140, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival.
