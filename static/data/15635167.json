{"description": "These apartments are in a very special co-op run by The Lombardy Hotel, offering full hotel service and amenities. My place is close to MOMA, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Grand Central, Central Park, Central Park Zoo, The Theater District, Lincoln Center, Rockefellar Plaza, The Empire State Building, Carnegie Hall, The Chrysler, Bryant Park, and Bloomingdale's. Excellent for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and pets under 50lbs as per hotel rules.\n\nThe space is a large studio room with a king bed. Room for a small cot. The biggest selling point is that this is an apartment in a hotel, and comes with all the standard perks of being in a 4-star hotel for less of a price: twice daily cleaning, concierge service.\n\n3 blocks away from the 59th Street/Lexington Ave stop, and 5 blocks away from the 51st/Lexington Ave stop. Also bus services on Madison Ave and Lexington Ave for uptown and downtown respectively.\n\nAs per hotel rules, checkout must be by 11am on the day of departure. Valet parking is available for $38/day.\n\nConsult the front desk for Wifi, or any other tech questions.\n\nBreakfast not offered complementary, just tea and coffee. However, a full breakfast can be purchased at either of the two restaurants in the building: American Cut and the Espresso Bar.

The check in procedure and communication were great. There was valet parking available which was really convenient. The only negative was that the bed was not very comfortable. A new mattress would make Ian's place perfect!"}
