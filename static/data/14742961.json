It's located in the most beautiful neighborhood in New York. I loved just sitting on the stoop and taking in the neighborhood.The building itself is awesome and the apartment and decor are so nice that I felt like I was staying in an actual bed and breakfast. Jennings was a good and attentive host. I'd definitely stay here again and I've already recommended it to friends. "}
