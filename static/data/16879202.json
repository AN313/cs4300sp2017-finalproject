There's culture, in the form of the American Museum of Natural History, the Beacon Theatre and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. And plenty of shopping, eating and nightlife as well. Read on for details about what to see and do.\n\n--Entertainment--\nIf downtown is defined by rock 'n' roll and Midtown is all about Broadway\u2019s glitz and glamour, the Upper West Side is where highbrow entertainment hits its highest notes. Exhibit A: Lincoln Center, a 16.3-acre complex that's home to 11 performing arts organizations\u2014among them the New York Philharmonic, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet. Before a show or after the curtain falls, relax by the fountain on the campus' sprawling plaza, or come early enough to take a behind-the-scenes tour of the campus and its venues. North along Broadway stands the Beacon Theatre, an art deco music hall that opened its doors in 1929. The landmark space has hosted such stars as Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones and the Allman Brothers, who played their final shows there in fall 2014; it was also the site of the 2011 and 2012 Tony Awards. One stop uptown on the 2 or 3 train gets you to Symphony Space, where two theaters showcase music, dance, comedy, drama, readings and screenings; the on-site caf\u00e9-bar hosts jazz sessions, cabaret and the occasional literary salon.\n\n--Shopping--\nBroadway, Amsterdam Avenue and Columbus Avenue are all busy commercial strips. Zabar's, on Broadway, opened in 1934 as a single market counter selling smoked fish. Today it's an Upper West Side institution where folks stop by to stock up on coffee, bagels, homemade soups, knishes and, of course, the fish that started it all. Bookworms should head across the street to Westsider Rare and Used Books, a reader's paradise with two levels of floor-to-ceiling titles, including some rare selections. Crafty types can let loose at yarn shop Knitty City. On Sundays, the schoolyard (and school) between 76th and 77th Streets at Columbus Avenue transforms into GreenFlea, an indoor-outdoor market selling rugs, jewelry, clothing, furniture, collectibles and food. The market is open year-round, rain or shine. The 79th Street Greenmarket, across from the American Museum of Natural History, is where locals stock up on fresh produce. Meanwhile, the Time Warner Center offers the Shops at Columbus Circle, which has name brands like Coach, J. Crew and Williams-Sonoma.\n\n--Brunch Spots--\nUpper West Side has a homey, residential feel, so it's no wonder that the area excels at that most comforting of meals: brunch. Come very hungry to Columbus Avenue's always-packed Good Enough to Eat, which offers generous portions of food with a side of cow memorabilia festooning the walls. Dishes like waffles stuffed with bacon, cinnamon-swirl French toast and omelets with Granny Smith apples and sharp cheddar won't do much for your diet, but they may lift your spirits. You'll forget you're in Manhattan at Sarabeth's, whose atmosphere evokes Montauk, Long Island, more than the big city. This upscale, green-awning classic specializes in fun twists on old standbys: dishes include a crisp potato waffle paired with chicken apple sausage and short-rib hash with eggs and jalape\u00f1o; a bloody mary can be ramped up with poached shrimp. Caff\u00e8 Storico, nestled inside the New-York Historical Society, offers diners a glass-windowed view of the institution as they dine on cured meats and cheeses, polenta and eggs with mushroom ragout and other Italian-inspired dishes. And, of course, Zabar's and Barney Greengrass are both fantastic places to pick up bagels and lox\u2014the quintessential NYC morning meal.\n\n--Nightlife--\nThe night's not over once you've finished dinner and dessert\u2014there are plenty of places to hit the town late in the evening. Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola at Lincoln Center\u2014named for a jazz legend and a soda sponsor\u2014serves up live jazz every night, along with soul food and drinks. Cleopatra's Needle\u2014located uptown along Broadway, at 92nd Street\u2014is another good place to hear jazz and have a bite; here, the menu's Middle Eastern. The Dead Poet names cocktails after authors, and the liquid literary tributes pack a serious punch. In addition to the Edgar Allan Poe and the Robert Frost, there's the Dead Poet cocktail, a secret recipe of seven liquors plus some sour mix. New Yorkers are famous for utilizing every inch of space, and the Boat Basin Caf\u00e9\u2014an open-air bar under a traffic circle\u2014is the nightlife equivalent of an apartment making great use of a Murphy bed. Located on the Hudson River at West 79th Street.\n\nGetting around New York City can be very easy or you can make it quite adventuresome. Subway, taxis and uber all at your fingertips. Good old fashion walking is always an option too! :)\n\nTaxi.   This is probably the best method to get around New York City if you are in a group of 2-4 people, but it's not always the fastest. NYC is notorious for traffic, and you can get stuck in it in a taxi.  You can easily get anywhere in Manhattan for no more than $10 - $15, split between a group, this is not much more than a subway ride ($2.75 per person), and it eliminates your chances of getting lost.  When at your hotel, ask your concierge or a doorman for a taxi and they will get one for you.  When on the street, simply look for taxis with their light on top lit but no \u201coff duty\u201d marked. \n\nWalking.  New York City is the world\u2019s greatest walking city.  All five boroughs can be explored on foot, but Manhattan is probably the easiest and most popular for pedestrians.\n\nManhattan is easiest for first-time visitors because all streets north of Houtson St. are laid out in a numbered grid pattern, with streets travelling east-west and avenues going north-south. Streets are numbered low to high going north, and avenues are numbered low to high going west. Twenty \"street\" blocks  (e.g. 40th St to 60th St) equals one mile (1.6 km) and usually takes 20 \u2013 30 minutes to walk. Fifth Avenue is the longitudinal meridian of Manhattan, and street numbers are prefaced with \"East\" and \"West\". For example, at 7th Avenue, New Yorkers say \"West 35th Street\" but at 3rd Avenue, say \"East 35th Street.\"\n\nWalking is best for people who want to see all the details - the architecture, people, businesses, and street life. If you walk around New York City, there is a good chance you will stroll past movie stars, television personalities, music icons, and models \u2013 whether you notice them or not.  \n\nSubway.  Besides walking, this is the most economical way to travel, and the fastest.  If you want to get a real sense of New York, the subway is a great way to go. MIllions of people use it every day, and it runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \n\nDespite popular movie lore, the subway is very safe.  The one main drawback for subways is construction and re-routing over the weekends and overnight. As a result, many tourists can find themselves going the wrong way or overshooting their stop due to being unfamiliar with the system. If this happens, you might waste a little time finding your way back, but don't worry about it.  Just ask a local passenger for help. But some travelers enjoy the adventure, and actually enjoy getting lost .   If you are going to use the transportation system, be sure to get a map and confirm your route with your concierge!\n\nBus. You can also use the bus system for cheap \"un-narrated tours\" of NYC! Buses, like taxis are subject to traffic jams, and they make frequent stops, but they are good for people who have trouble with stairs or walking, or if you have a chunk of time to fill and want to see the city from the outside. All public buses \"kneel\" - i.e. they lower themselves to the ground or easier boarding - and are wheelchair accessible.\n\nLOCATION\nI'm about 3 block to the nearest train station (C and E train) is on 72nd Street, about 3 blocks from the 1 train on 66th Street, and 3 blocks from 1,2, 3 train on 72nd Street.  I\u2019m 2 subway stops to Time Square station (42nd street) (~5-7 subway walk). I\u2019m 1 block from Central Park (less than ~5 minute walk).\n\nI will send you specific travel information regarding how to get to the condo after you confirm your reservation. \n\nLUGGAGE STORAGE\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t accommodate any early check in (before 3pm) or late checkout (after 11am); However, below is the closest storage options that you can try to store your luggage for a small fee. \n\nCity CoPilot \nAt the register, give the coupon code: \"NYC Travel\" for a discount. \n777 8th Avenue, New York (in between 47th and 48th Streets) inside the Gray Line Visitor Center. \nOpen from 8:30 a.m. - 8:00 p.m.\nWebsite: (URL HIDDEN)\nCost: ~$5-$10 \n\nIMPORTANT \nMy building is very quiet building with elderly neighbors so NO partying or loud music is allowed. If you (and your group) can ensure a that you will not be disruptive to my neighbors what so ever, then I'll be happy to have you your group. Just let me know if this will be problem prior to booking. \n\nPARKING\nI recommend not driving if possible, because sometimes parking can be a challenge in New York City; The only FREE parking is street parking and depending on the time of day, street parking sometimes is easy to find nearby. However you do have to follow street sweeping rules (which will be posted).  \n\nThere are lots of PAID parking nearby, trust me you will see the tons of signs. One parking lot to consider is  Icon Parking on 143 W 69th St. Their prices vary, so just (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) their name and address and it should come up with specific info. \n \nKEY PICK UP/DROP OFF\nI use a lock box for key exchange so you don\u2019t have to worry about coordinating with me the day of your arrival. I will send you the lockbox location and instructions at least 1 week prior to your arrival.", "name": "Central Park Upper West Side Condo", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e073423e-3b3d-4e6b-8b24-36430cea0e61.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16879202", "id": "16879202", "price": 255, "review": "Its fantastic location!!
