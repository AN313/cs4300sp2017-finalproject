Nelly is a great host. She is very communicative and check in and out were a breeze. The apartment is in the basement. It is in a safe neighborhood. Canarsie is cool! Large queen bed is very comfortable. Wifi was very, very weak. Electrical outlets are minimal. Heater/cooler unit in bedroom next to bed kept waking me up when it turned on since it is in fixed position and I couldn't move it.  Bathroom ceiling is very low. My stay went very, very well. Thank you Nelly for hosting me!"}
