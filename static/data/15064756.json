{"description": "Charming studio apartment in a beautiful and safe neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. I live in a very clean studio apartment that will have everything you need. \n\nIt's a 8 min walk to the R train on 95th Street or a 10 min walk the R train on 86th Street. It will take you about 45 minutes to get to the city.\n\nYou will have the space entirely to yourself. Bay Ridge is a quaint family neighborhood with tons of great restaurants, shops, and bars. There is a Starbucks Coffee, Italian bakery, pizzeria, grocery store, and bank within two blocks from my house. I keep my apartment very clean. Fresh linen and towels will be provided. \n\nThe apartment is a spacious studio apartment with a newly renovated kitchen, heat, air condition, and a washer/dryer in the basement. There is also an elevator in the building.\n\nI expect you to respect and treat my space as would you your own. It's a super clean apartment with an extremely comfortable plush mattress and couch.
