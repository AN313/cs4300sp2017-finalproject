He was a great host. The place was just as cute as it is in the pictures, and it is in a great area.  Amir was very kind to give us suggestions on great places to eat in the area.  If we didn't have family in Manhattan, we would have never left Brooklyn.  There is so much to see and do.  I wish that the weather had been nice enough to enjoy the beautfil roof top deck.  Maybe next time......"}
