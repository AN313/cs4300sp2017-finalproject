She was flexible with check in and was quick to help us with the key exchange. Additionally, her apartment, while simple, was warm and clean. And the kitchen was quite nice (as pictured) with plenty of space to store/prepare food. A few more details\u2026I recently booked this apartment for my family, so they could stay near our apartment; and Marie's listing was one of the more affordable options. However, I was disappointed to discover that though wifi was listed, it was not available. Additionally, the beds in the photos are actually air mattresses. Though a higher quality air mattress, that is still not as comfortable as a bed. Additionally no linens were available, so be sure to bring your own."}
