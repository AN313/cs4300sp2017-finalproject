{"description": "Surround yourself with 120 year-old original exposed brick, lush greenery, and natural light in this gem! A stone's throw away from NYC's funkiest restaurants, bars, & coffee shops and authentic Italian bakeries and pizzerias, you won't want to leave. You\u2019ll feel relaxed and recharged every time you come home...even in a city that never sleeps. The highlights of Williamsburg will be at your fingertips, and with the L-Train just around the corner, you can be in Manhattan in less than 10 mins.\n\nYou will have two BIKE SHARE keys to use while you are here for FREE. There is a \"Citibike\" station right outside the door and is the easiest and most enjoyable way to get around and explore the city.\n\n2 minute walk to the L-Train which is just 2 stops away from Manhattan (10mins).\n\nYou must like cats and be willing to watch over our cute, friendly, low maintenance cat while we are gone.", "name": "One of a Kind 19th Century Williamsburg Wonder", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6d4cdb6c-7e06-44ad-a285-6ef6c26746ac.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15181062", "id": "15181062", "price": 345, "review": "Great place and a great guy ;)"}
