{"description": "My place is a cozy two room studio conveniently located in Bed Stuy on the border of Bushwick. You will have easy access to two of the hippest neighborhoods in the cities best borough, Brooklyn. Hip bars, galleries, and restaurants are literally within steps of the building. The J train is just a block away leaving you 25 minutes from the Lower East Side and points in lower Manhattan near WTC. B38 and Express B46 bus lines are literally right outside the apartment.", "name": "Cozy Bed Stuy Two Room Studio", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9464d43b-d4f9-4503-a196-28f5501cb50a.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14867152", "id": "14867152", "price": 50, "review": "The host canceled this reservation 45 days before arrival.
