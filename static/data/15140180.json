{"description": "Our home is a lovely 2 story, 3 bedroom house near many attractions; Brooklyn College, King's Theater, Prospect Park, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Children's Museum, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, Prospect Park Zoo, Brooklyn Central Library, & Grand Army Plaza.\n\nYou\u2019ll love our place because of the light, bright open spaces, ample storage, clean simple midcentury furnishings, and quaint block. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.\n\nGuests will have exclusive access to the upper two floors of the house but not the basement. The basement is fully finished and has its own separate entrance. We'll likely be down there during your stay so please don't be alarmed if you see us coming and going.", "name": "Beautiful spacious 3 bedroom Central Brooklyn Home", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/73abaf32-0aaa-4f52-b269-56e86947d97d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15140180", "id": "15140180", "price": 195, "review": "Dw's place was very nice with a cozy atmosphere.
