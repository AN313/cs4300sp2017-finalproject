{"description": "Sunny and cozy one-bedroom apartment in an absolutely perfect location! The building overlooks a quiet, tree-lined street and is only a five minute walk from the Meatpacking District, Highline, and West Chelsea galleries.\n\nLocated in a beautiful, historic townhouse, on a picturesque, tree-lined street, the apartment has enormous windows, great light, and perfect views of the street. A great location, but the apartment is  private and very quiet, especially in the evenings.\n\nThe location is perfect! Chelsea is a classic New Yorker neighborhood and you won't see many tourists here. \n\nAnd the restaurants! Ninth Avenue and Chelsea are filled with amazing local restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops. Must trys include the Meatball Shop, Billy's Bakery, Fonda, Pastai, Fika Coffee, Gelato Guisto, Foragers, and Milkbar... all less than two blocks away! Chelsea market is just a few minutes further and is the perfect place to spend a weekend morning.\n\nAll off the westside subway lines are within a 5 minute walk of the apartment (L, ACE and 123) at 14th street or 23rd street. The apartment is one subway stop from Penn Station if you are arriving from Newark airport, JFK, or by train.", "name": "Chic+Sunny Chelsea 1 BR by Highline", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e7f65314-3b36-400d-a826-1cb1a768c45d.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15953144", "id": "15953144", "price": 209, "review": "Katherine was very responsive and easy to get in touch with.
