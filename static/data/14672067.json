{"description": "This cozy basement apartment is full of character and flair. Make yourself at home in an artsy space while being conveniently located just steps from the 2 and 5 subway lines, 15 minutes to Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park, and 15-20 minutes from downtown Brooklyn! It's about a 35-40 minute (direct) ride to 42nd street in Manhattan.\n\nThere is a private entrance to the apartment for guests though the entrance is a bit cramped as it doubles as a storage area for the entire house.\n\nVery comfy and homely!\n\nFull apartment\n\nAs needed.\n\nI love that my neighborhood is quiet, residential, safe, and has lots of great Caribbean eats nearby!\n\nThe 2 and 5 trains are located right around the corner !\n\nIt's easy to catch a yellow/green cab on Nostrand avenue, otherwise Uber/Lyft are always an option.", "name": "Cozy spacious basement apartment!", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d28ba458-71e1-4796-b766-570049562cb0.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/14672067", "id": "14672067", "price": 85, "review": "The place was great.
