{"description": "Our comfortable two bedroom apartment is just located next to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. You can get great view of Manhattan, New Jersey and of course Sunset. A few blocks to 36th Train Terminal for N/D/R Trains. The room is nice for One People..Express Trains in Brooklyn which could bring you to Manhattan within 20mins. \nBut you have to clean up once the kitchen is used.\nWe would always come to the apartment to check if everything is ok and clean the common area.", "name": "near DNRQ subway train, whole apartment.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d85afa24-1475-4c82-a7b4-a82c143b2aa3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15165794", "id": "15165794", "price": 80, "review": "The place is in a very nice location and Melody was always available to help.
