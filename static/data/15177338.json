Walkable to many restaurants, shops, grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. Very convenient also to the subway. It took us about 15 minutes to get to Rockefeller Center and 15 minutes (by car) to family who live in Queens. It is quite spacious - lots of room for my husband, our baby, and me. \nWe found the linens (bedding, towels, and pillows) to be quite minimal and the apartment to be quite worn in spots. Also, we were not able to regulate the heat and it was hot!"}
