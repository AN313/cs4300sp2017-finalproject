{"description": "My place is only 10-15 minutes away from midtown, Manhattan!  Astoria has great food, lots of bars and there are many supermarkets nearby. You\u2019ll love my place because it's very cozy, clean and updated! This is a new building so everything is new.  I am available anytime by phone to give any suggestions for food and activities around the city!\n\nThis studio will make you feel like you're in a hotel with a cloud-like mattress and modern furniture. The kitchen is separated from the living space and the bathroom is pretty large.\n\nYou have access to the whole apartment, including the kitchenware, plates, and glasses.\n\nI'm available by phone 24-7 if you need any suggestions around the neighborhood or the city.\n\nAstoria is a super safe neighborhood and conveniently located only a few stops away from Manhattan. There's also a track/park nearby called Astoria Park where you can run (for those who like to exercise). It's right by the Triboro bridge so there are amazing views of Manhattan!\n\nThe N and Q trains are only a block away. There is parking around the neighborhood but there's alternate side restrictions on the weekdays. Just make sure you always read the signs before you park!", "name": "MODERN COZY NYC APT", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/934b7ff6-733e-484e-9e0e-a5b81b124364.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15344495", "id": "15344495", "price": 99, "review": "Huong's place was very clean, modern and spacious. It's perfect for singles or couples. There are many restaurants around the area that are within walking distances and the apt is a 2-3 min walk to the NQR station, approx. 25 min to Times Sq, which is super convenient. Overall, GREAT location!\n\nHuong was very attentive and responsive during my stay. She offered great suggestions on restaurants and activities around the neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again! :)"}
