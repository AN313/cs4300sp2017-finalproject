The location worked great for me, being just a quick walk to the 1 line subway, with an awesome 24/7 grocer a few blocks away. There was tons of space in the apartment, for a great value. Everything was clean and in good working order, and because I had a two week stay, I really felt that I was living like a local. I would definitely consider coming back to stay again! :)"}
