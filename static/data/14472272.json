It could comfortably fit a couple and also has a room divider where friends can have private time separate from whoever is in the bedroom. Great location, very safe, clean, and lively. Has tons of dishes, pots, and utensils for your use. Didn't have any issues with privacy whatsoever. Definitely a steal for anyone visiting New York "}
