{"description": "Secluded studio located in the epicenter of Williamsburg. Perfectly situated 30 feet from the L, putting you one stop away from Manhattan and blocks away from the best nightlife in Williamsburg.\n\nFair warning: the bathroom is quite small, but the shower is surprisingly spacious. Overall, the space is \"intimate\" and is best suited for one person or a couple. \n\nBe sure to enjoy the awesome patio area right outside the front door. Enjoy!", "name": "Cozy studio in the heart of Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/440d7b97-2ed4-4f59-a285-874b3a7e8ec1.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16710034", "id": "16710034", "price": 125, "review": "great location!"}
