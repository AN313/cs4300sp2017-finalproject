{"description": "My place is close to nightlife, public transport, the city center, Barclay's Center, Williamsburg, Prospect Park and much more. You\u2019ll love my place because of the ambiance, the light, the neighborhood, and the art. My place is good for couples and families (with older kids).\n\nMy neighborhood is really diverse and that's what I love about it. It's quiet and residential on my side of the block, and hustle and bustle on the other.  So very close by, you'll find 24 hour bodegas, restaurants and nightlife. I'm very close to Williamsburg and regularly walk into East Williamsburg to dine at a Roberta's for pizza and Momo's for sushi.\n\nPublic transportation is very easy around my apartment. There's an M/J line very close as well as an L near by", "name": "Lovingly Curated Brooklyn Haven", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/35bce457-9082-4f4f-bbb4-bf331a212c88.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15927599", "id": "15927599", "price": 110, "review": "We loved staying in Toni's place! We had just been in a hotel the night before and we talked about how much more comfortable we were in this space. We also walked to Williamsburg on Tuesday to check it out which was super fun. My husband walked around the neighborhood the most, going to the store, etc. He loved everything. Thank you again! "}
