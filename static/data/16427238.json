I particularly enjoyed that the living was really open. However, the kitchen and bathroom was small. The kitchen wasn't a huge problem for us though cause we ate out most of the time. Bathroom sink was really small. When I would wash my face, water will fall on the floor. We were two girls who stayed together and there was only a small mirror in the bathroom, no other mirrors elsewhere not ever with the dresser. But if a small bathroom sink and kitchen don't bother you then I def would suggest this place. "}
