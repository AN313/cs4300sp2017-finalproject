{"description": "This is a cozy, plant-filled oasis from the city! My spacious one bedroom apartment is located in Prospect Park South, a small, quiet neighborhood that is \u2013 as it sounds \u2013 nestled right below Prospect Park; my building is seconds from an express train that can get you into Manhattan in under 20 minutes. My apartment is warm, [hopefully] eclectically decorated and a wonderful place of respite or work for a winter weekend in NYC.", "name": "Plant-filled 1 BD by Prospect Park", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/655054e6-9f37-48b8-ae2a-cdcf10d7eb80.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17311284", "id": "17311284", "price": 100}
