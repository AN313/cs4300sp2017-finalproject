{"description": "The lovely studio is located in the heart of NYC - West Village. It is upstairs from the best restaurants, cafes, bars, boutique shops (Bleecker St), galleries, jazz, comedy, Washington Square Park... Murray's Cheese, Joe's pizza, Grom ice cream, Keste pizza, Market Table, Buvette, etc yet quiet at night. It is light filled, clean and cozy. It's the perfect base to explore NYC and relax in a tucked away street in the midst of it all!\n\nThe apartment is beautifully light filled with two large windows facing the quiet street. \n\nIt is a well-kept walk-up building, 3 flights up. It feels airy and welcoming. \n\nAs Manhattan apartments go - it's a small, cozy studio with a kitchen, full bed and small bathroom - ideal for solo travellers but can accommodate 2.\n\nYou can access the entire apartment\n\nI will most likely be away for the duration of your stay. I am quick with communication and ensure a smooth check-in and check-out.\n\nRight around the corner (2 mins walk) from West 4th subway station - access to A, B, C, D, E, F, M trains. Also around the corner (4 mins walk) from Christopher St Sheridan Square subway station - access to 1 and 2 trains.", "name": "Light filled studio in the heart of NYC", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fbd3d8db-a285-4d17-918d-ea9b5c016348.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15644337", "id": "15644337", "price": 180, "review": "Great location!
