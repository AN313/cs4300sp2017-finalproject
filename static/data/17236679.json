{"description": "This is a cozy, well equipped studio that is comfortable for a couple or solo traveler who are here for business or pleasure.  It is 35 minutes away from Times Square.  The area has many good restaurants and 24 hour grocery stores for your convenience.\n\nThis is a work/live studio. The main room is the studio with a bed and bathroom. The other room is set up as a Yoga studio you can use that room to store your luggage. Or do some yoga if you like :)\n\nYou have access to the whole place. The yoga room is for classes while I'm in town. You can use that space I just ask if you can leave it nice and neat because I have classes sometimes that are last minute and the place needs to be ready.\n\nI'm usually not in town. But am very available for questions and concerns by calling me or texting\n\nMy neighborhood has the best Chinese restaurants. It has 24 hour grocery stores. And foot massage places that are open very late.\n\nThe 7 train stop is about a 10-12 minute walk from the place. It is the Main Street station on the 7 line.", "name": "Bohemian NYC getaway (Flushing)", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/737b96be-e183-4765-ba00-b5e6b0623bd3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/17236679", "id": "17236679", "price": 70, "review": "Nice to live in"}
