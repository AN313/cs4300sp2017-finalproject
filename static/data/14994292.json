The location was perfect for us (three girls visiting from the UK), a nice quiet area with great cafes, and close to the subway linking straight into Manhattan. The hosts were in touch to check we were ok, and helpfully flexible with checking in and out times. The best bit of course was Franklin the cat who we adored! Thank you for a great stay."}
