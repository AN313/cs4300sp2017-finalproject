{"description": "This cozy studio is tucked away in the heart of Williamsburg. Steps away from some of the best bars, restaurants and boutiques in New York City. If you're looking for a true, NYC experience without the stuffy hotels and annoying tourists, this is the place for you! But don't worry, it's conveniently less than a block away from the Bedford L train stop, making the commute into Manhattan less than 5 minutes.\n\nMy apartment is set back from the street and accessed via a gate so although you'll enjoy the convenience of being steps away from Williamsburg's night life, you won't hear a thing once you're home. \n\nFront yard with plants and a picnic table sits in front of the home and is great for some extra secluded space.\n\nFull access! Mi casa es tu casa.\n\nI don't go anywhere without my phone so I will be very reachable if you run into any questions during your stay. My neighbors are also gems and available in case of emergency.\n\nYou really can't beat the location. Steps away from coffee, bagels, the subway, great shopping and yummy restaurants. Some of my favorites include, Toby's, Cafe Mogador, Bagelsmith and Joes Pizza.", "name": "Cozy, Clean Studio in Heart of Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b54cd2c6-328e-40fe-8050-eb887cc41182.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16225882", "id": "16225882", "price": 185}
