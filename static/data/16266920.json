As expected Napos place was a New York style apartment. Small but charming. 5 min walk to central park, 2 min from the metro station an a great coffee dealer. All you need is within walking distance and you get quiet a descent place for the price you pay. Never forget you wont pay for a five star spa hotel but for a great start to explore NYC by foot and public transportation. The apartment had all we needed travelling light. Definately recommended for your stay at New York City!"}
