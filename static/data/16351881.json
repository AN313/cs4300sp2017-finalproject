{"description": "Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Eclectic, bohemian, French, Southwestern would best describe our place. I like walking through the apt and each room has it's own style. We are  2 blocks to the L train Bedford stop. Step outside and you are surrounded with the most adorable, delicious, artistic and one of a kind restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and of course the fun and interesting people watching. 10min subway to Manhattan or cab. Neighborhood is covered in art murals so have your cameras ready :)\n\nEach room has its own uniqueness and theme :) Railroad Apt.\n\nAccess to everything. Except the one closet which will be locked and the vintage Danish Modern dresser (family heirloom).\n\nI will definitely be reachable at all times. :)\n\nOur street and neighborhood is stunning. Very iconic Brooklyn with brownstone buildings lining the street. Looks like a film set. Tons of cafes, restaurants and shopping.\n\nL train Bedford stop is 2 blocks away (3min walk), 10 mins to Manhattan or cab about the same time.", "name": "Artsy Fartsy and Cozy with private deck & garden.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2156dbea-688b-4ab8-81a7-e00235b21183.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16351881", "id": "16351881", "price": 250}
