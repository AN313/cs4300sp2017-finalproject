{"description": "Charming studio with a working brick fireplace that's just feet away from Barclays Center. The studio is fully furnished. The location is amazing as it's feet from Barclay's Center, in prime Park Slope.\n\nThe space is a fully furnished studio two blocks from Barclays Center. There's TV, Netflix, an Xbox, record player, and more.\n\nTv, Xbox, cable, fireplace, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom.\n\nMinimal.\n\nBustling with hip, young families, Park Slope, Brooklyn, has long been a bastion of the intelligentsia. Fine Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne residences grace the landmarked Park Slope Historic District on the western edge of Prospect Park, which some argue is a more successful green space than Olmsted and Vaux\u2019s earlier collaboration, Central Park. Meanwhile, Gotham\u2019s \u201cother Fifth Avenue\u201d is packed with popular restaurants and interesting shops, and the neighborhood\u2019s laid-back nightlife scene caters to straight and gay crowds alike.\n\nAtlantic Terminal is feet away, 8 trains, 6 buses and LIRR. There's buses to casino's, and much more all within feet from the apartment.", "name": "Sunny studio in the heart of Park Slope.", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d174a767-3866-4554-9295-9d654cfe52c2.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15543965", "id": "15543965", "price": 150, "review": "Great location and Ant was always responsive to questions via text.
