{"description": "Our home in the heart of Williamsburg has been lovingly decorated and offers a beautiful and calm respite from the city. The apartment is south facing, with wall to ceiling windows that provide light all day. We also reside only a few blocks from everything Williamsburg has to offer, such as the waterfront, Smorgasborg, Brooklyn Bowl, Brooklyn Brewery, Brooklyn Winery, and countless great restaurants and bars. If Manhattan is in your plans, the L train will get you door to door in 5-10 minutes.", "name": "Spacious, bright, art-filled apartment in W'burg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d8e86f42-d52a-4d41-8eeb-6bf9b7663fc3.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/15238852", "id": "15238852", "price": 200, "review": "I booked this apartment for my mum to stay in while she visited me (I live down the road.) I spent quite a bit of time there with her as well - and we both absolutely adored it. The place was incredibly clean, chic, and comfortable. The bed was EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable (according to my mum.) We've had trouble with AirBnBs getting too much noise from the street before but this place is incredibly tranquil (but just blocks away from awesome bars and restaurants.) Nick and Anne Marie were excellent communicators - and this was probably the best AirBnb experience I've had to date. Highly, highly recommend! "}
