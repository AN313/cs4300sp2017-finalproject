The person told me I had to wait 3 hours to check in. So I waited the 3 hours and nobody contacted me at that point. The host went dark and ruined my trip by not answering. DO NOT STAY HERE. I believe this is a scam and the other reviews can probably attest to that. Very bad experience being left without a place, waiting for 6 hours  and finding another. "}
