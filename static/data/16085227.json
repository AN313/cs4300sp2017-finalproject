{"description": "This sun drenched 1 bedroom apartment is located in the heart of hip Williamsburg.  It's just a short 3 blocks from the Bedford L stop which is just 1 stop away from Manhattan. Bedford Avenue provides you with endless food, shopping, and bar options, all within walking distance. McCarren Park is 2 blocks away with sports fields, greenery, and sun bathing (weather permitting!) For those with allergies, please note a dog lives here. Great for couples and explorers!\n\nGreat railroad style apartment. I live here, so it's cozy and comfortable in the winter, and cool in the summer. It's great for a couple, but also has enough space for a third traveler without feeling cramped. Full bathroom and kitchen.\n\nYou have access to the entire apartment. If you're there, I'm not :)\n\nAgain, if you're there, I'm not. But feel free to contact me with any issues!\n\nWilliamsburg is possibly the coolest place on the planet right now. Tons of bars, eateries, shops, parks, and more. While you may be here to visit Manhattan, you'll fall in love with Brooklyn. You can access it all from this convenient location.\n\nL train two blocks away. Walking distance from the G, J, M, and Z trains in addition to a lot of buses. Additionally, tons of cabs and Ubers in the area. You can actually walk to Manhattan over the Williamsburg bridge.\n\nThis is New York City. There is noise both from the street and your neighbors. Please keep that in mind when booking this apartment. Respect the neighbors and the hood.", "name": "1 Bedroom Apt. in Prime Williamsburg", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/794a72e0-83e7-4ef0-98cd-30bc56c5dbdd.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16085227", "id": "16085227", "price": 150, "review": "Great location, beautiful flat, and amazing host!
