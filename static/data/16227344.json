{"description": "My place is only three blocks from Central Park. You\u2019ll love my place because of the vintage industrial style, the light, the neighborhood and the coziness. Its a very safe and quiet neighbourhood. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.\n\nBedroom looks out into a pretty and quiet backyard. \nThe living room has a wonderful couch, piano, books, and a spacious kitchen with everything you need. \nSpace for all your belongings will be provided.\n\nI am usually out of the country when I sublet my space but my former roomate (who knows all the ins and outs of the space) is in the city and available if anything should come up. \nI am also always reachable via phone.\n\nThe 6 Train Subway line is literally 2 steps from the front door, as is the crosstown bus.", "name": "Upper East Side Industrial Chiq Artistic 1 Bedroom", "picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7397ab60-f463-4e96-886e-28f6d9342b52.jpg?aki_policy=large", "url": "airbnb.com/rooms/16227344", "id": "16227344", "price": 117, "review": "The place is very nice and cozy, and Steph has been great receiving and helping us."}
