The check in was a breeze. I had told Anna that we would be arriving at the unit earlier than the actually check in time, and Anna was kind enough to let us in earlier. Within a matter of minutes we were in. Check out was just as easy.\n2. The location is fantastic! Safe and relatively close to the sightseeing areas in Brooklyn (eg. Prospect park, botanical gardens,etc)\n3. The unit itself was clean and surprisingly spacious! The decor was beautiful! \n4. The parking is easy and safe. \n\nMy only concern was the shower head. The attachment that holds the shower head up was broken and therefore i had to hold up the shower head with my hands in order to shower. It got the job done but it was a little inconvenient. \n\nOverall, it was an amazing stay. You definitely get what you pay for!  "}
