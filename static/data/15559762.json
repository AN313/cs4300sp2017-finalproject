The unit was perfect for us, a family of three. The beds were comfortable and the unit was well heated (it was cold outside). Having a kitchen and dining table made eating in / bringing food home to eat very easy. There is a Trader Joe's close by for groceries too. The neighborhood is quiet and very safe. Everything we needed was just a couple blocks away at most - many excellent restaurants and the subway. We loved being so close to Central Park and having access to the lake. We highly recommend staying here. "}
